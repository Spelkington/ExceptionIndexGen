     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- commissioners' meeting, Town Board of Battle Mountain, and Austin Board of County Highway Commissioners, September 14th, 2017.  
     Please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance.  Sean, will you lead us.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yep.
     
     (Pledge of Allegiance) 
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  I'd like a moment of silence, please.
     
     (Moment of silence)
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Thank you.
     Lander County Commissioners may break for lunch from 12:00 p.m. to 1:15 p.m.

COMMISSIONER REPORTS
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Commissioners' reports on meetings, conferences, and seminars attended.
     Judie?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I have none.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  I have a couple of items.  
     First was the exciting one.  We had our hospital board meeting.  
     On EMS, the hospital board decided that it would be better to have EMS remain at the hospital.  So we'll -- should have some negotiations about how we're going to continue to handle that.  
     I think for now, from what I'm hearing, they're content to leave the contract as is.  But we can look forward to having some more discussion on that in the future.  Our --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  When was that?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- hospital board elected to disengage from our contract with our CEO Bryan Hargis.  So he is no longer employed at the hospital.  
     And we put Kathy Ancho, the previous CEO, in the position of interim CEO until we can find someone else.  
     So that was a lot of discussion.  We had a lot of people at the hospital board meeting.  There were -- there were at least a hundred people from the community there to participate in that discussion and that decision.
     Also of note, Steve Boline, the CFO at the hospital, resigned from his position.  
     So there we are on that.
     We do have another hospital board meeting tonight.  And we'll be discussing some direction to give our interim CEO and the approach we're going to take towards seeking a new CEO.
     So if any of you are interested, that should be interesting.  5:00 o'clock over at John Peters building tonight.
     Also yesterday, we had our debt management meeting.  And the county continues to have no debt.  That makes that meeting really easy.
     There were a couple of -- of the districts that did not submit their five-year plan as they were supposed to.  So we're going to send a friendly letter to them asking them to do that.  Apparently, we have no authority to make them do that.  So we're just going to request that they do.  And then that will be completed.
     And that's all I've got.  
     Sean?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I don't have anything.  
     We did the wine walk this weekend.  Patsy, you were there.  Was that the first time you went?  Or did you go last year?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No.  I -- I have always gone, but usually I'm giving out the wine.
     I'm -- I'm one -- one of the -- the business people.  But this is the first time I've actually been on the walk.  I've always been to the dinner.  Yeah.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But, yeah, it was really good.  If you guys ever get a chance, you need to check that out.  Austin puts on a very good wine walk.  
     But besides that, no, I attended the hospital board meeting.  Saw everything firsthand.
     So besides that, I really don't have anything to report on.  
     Patsy?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.  Yes, I do have a few things.  
     On August 25th we had our NACO meeting, and as I have reported before, our executive director Jeff Fontaine will be leaving us.  And so we appointed Dagny Stapleton, who is our deputy director right now, to take over as our executive director.  And we're thrilled to be able to do that in-house.
     Let's see.
     Couple of things that I wanted to talk on.  We had a couple presentations.  And one of them was on the telephone number 211.
     And I don't know how many of you are familiar with that one at all.  But actually that has a little bit of history.  It was developed in the year 2000.  The federal communications group, the FCC, said that they were going to have all states use the 211 number.  And it's called "Get Connected.  Get Answers."  And it's in lieu of the 911.
     The 911 is an emergency number, as we all know.  But 70 to 80 percent of the calls that come in on that are not the true emergencies that the sheriff's office should be handling.  
     So -- but -- but they are emergencies to the people themselves.  I need this.  I need that.  Whatever.
     So they decided they'd have the 211.  And they mandated that the states, you know, all have that.  
     And actually in 2005, our legislature added it to our NRS.
     So what it is, is to -- to have the people get used to calling the 211 number when it's not a medical or a criminal emergency or something that's not a true emergency that minute.
     And it's designed to help absolutely everything.  In fact, I have a list, and I just want to share that with you to see -- like, well, that's the Spanish.  So I'm not going read that one.
     Medical and mental health resources, employment support, programs for children, youth, and families, pregnancy services, food pantries, community crisis and disaster.
     And that's one of the things they're looking at.  So they could look there to do research and recovery if we have any kind of a crisis.  
     Housing help, utility payment assistance, support for seniors and persons with disabilities, and many more public services and resources.
     So that's -- we had a presentation on that.  And I think it's one of the things that we probably should be looking at to probably advertise a little bit more, certainly the name of the game and where it's going.  And here, like I said, it's been out for quite a while.  I couldn't believe it.  I -- I've seen the number before, but I guess I kind of just thought it was one of those other numbers.  And I didn't really realize it until after the presentation.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  So it's in play right now?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Oh, yes.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If I dial it right now?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It has been for many years.  Of course now Washoe and Clark has it right there.
     I did call it to see what was -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- going on.  And it says, put your zip code in.
     Do not recognize your zip code.
     But that's okay.  They said, stay on the line.  
     It's a 24/7.  And I didn't stay on the line.  I thought, well, that's okay.  I won't bother them.  
     But -- but it is something we need to -- to look into.  And I wanted to keep you all aware of that one.
     Okay.  Let's see.  
     I had another one I wanted to share.  And this is regarding one of our legislative -- Senate Bill 377.
     Remember that's the one, the right to counsel commission that went through with -- in the last legislature.
     They are asking for six nominees of -- counties in a population with less than a hundred thousand for possible appointment by the governor to four positions on this Nevada Right to Counsel Commission.
     So I thought, you know, NACO remain- -- remained neutral on that one.  So we did not want to put anybody in.  But if you think there's anybody or even if yourself, Counselor, if there's -- you would like to sit in on that, please let me know.  Or if someone you think that should.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'd like to sit on it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And we'll at least put the name in.  Yeah.  Because --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Put mine in.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- they've asked us for -- for six of them.  
     Just in case there's any personal interest on that.  And I -- I know you did.  And so I thought maybe you might like to.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes, I would. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Thank you.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  Let's see.  
     On September 11th, we had an airport advisory meeting.  A couple of things on that.  One is our plan for the water line extension project.  The plans are in.  And I did deliver one to Public Works.
     We're still asking for an alternate on our board.  So.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  The airport? 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.  You were looking into that one.  
     And we wondered if -- if there's any way we could get a fuel report.  And I don't know who has that.  Maybe Walt?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I'm sorry.  What?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  A fuel -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  A fuel? 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- report, like -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- how many gallons --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- or something?  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Because they'd be interested in -- in -- in -- of what's going on at our airport board meetings on that.  So I'd appreciate that.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  Commissioner Waits, can I address the airport issue real quick?  Or would you like me to meet with you privately later?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Or the board?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  By all means.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  It would require an ordinance change.  And we actually have to look at two alternates to -- to keep it an odd number on the board.
     Currently that would make you an even number.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No, because the alternate would only be able to vote if the other per- -- if one person wasn't there.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  All right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So -- so we don't need two alternates.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:   They just fill in if a board member is not there.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We only have three board members.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And so the alternate -- the alternate can attend anytime they want.  But they simply don't vote.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's correct.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  If all three are there.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So we're fine.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay?  But, yes, I know it's an ordinance change.  But we feel it's extremely important because with just two, it's just not enough input.
     So appreciate that.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  On the -- the 12th, on Wednesday, I did attend the open house for the -- the human-powered speed challenge.  
     And, of course, I -- and I was delayed this morning coming in.  They're -- they're out doing their thing.  And it's a beautiful day for racing.  That was really interesting.  
     And I also attended the drone workshop, which was -- what or why of small unar- -- unmanned aerial systems.  
     And our chair was there.  Commissioner Doug was with us on that one too.  
     That was put on by cooperative extension.  And the director of -- of cooperative extension from UNR was there.  
     Also, one other thing on NACO, they did -- we had a presentation from Paul Peterson regarding the fires.  And I was just going to share that with you on where they were.  
     This was actually through August 25th.  In Nevada, we have one million sixty-two -- 1,062,299 acres that have burned.  And they are still compiling and validating the numbers on that.
     But they -- they broke it down on how much actually was county, how much was the Bureau of Land Management.  
     And BLM had 704,997 acres, 383 fires on that one.
     Division of Forestry had 70 fires, 296,643.
     The Forest Service, 58 fires from 5,855.
     And the different Nevada counties had 49 fires with 54,793.
     And then they actually broke it down to how much were human causes and all those.  The human-caused acreage fire was 283 fires.
     I just thought that was kind of interesting with what was happening and where we are with everything.
     So just passing that on.
     Thank you.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Art?  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Thank you.  
     Art?  
     Oh, sorry there.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.  I had -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- a SLUAC meeting last Friday and PLUAC on Monday.  
     And I -- I have to apologize.  I had a stack of handouts, some pamphlets and maps.  But I don't know where they got to.
     I checked my desk this morning.  And I had a few of the copies that I'd run off, but I don't know where the pamphlets are.  
     One of the big topics at SLUAC was the RS 2477 roads.  We need to get our plan going.
     I guess Nye County has the best -- the best one so far.  And I've given Keith a copy of the Nye County plan.  
     Mining legislature, the presentation from the Department of Mines was very positive.  
     They got -- a portion of the bill was -- was securing five acre-feet of water for exploration, which is more than enough for -- for that.
     Mining seems to be doing well.  And it was interesting that Gabbs, a place close to my heart, has the best deposit of magnesium oxide.  And Clayton Can- -- Canyon in Esmeralda County at Silver Peak has the best lithium deposit.
     NDOT presented One Plan for Nevada, which basically is the experts will prioritize what needs to be done.  And they'll do those projects first.  
     I did bring up Bob Scott Summit.  And there wasn't much of a reply on that.
     Lincoln County, Nye County, and Elko County all have some kind of OHV program where the residents can drive their OHVs on county and state.  
     So also talk in SLUAC was water.  Get your local water plan for rural counties was -- was addressed.  We need to find out how much is avail- -- available and how we need to allocate this and make a priority.
     On Monday night I spoke with Rex Massey at PLUAC.  And agreed that we need to get started on a good water plan.  Because the experts agree that it may not be a reality now, but day by day we're getting closer to monitoring domestic wells.
     So the critical basin and all that may just get pushed to the side, especially with this Pershing County stuff.  And there may be a mandate to have meters on your wells.  And they know how much it's going to cost, $1300.  And they'll have somebody from the state going out and checking your -- your water.
     So those things are imperatives that we should address.
     That's it.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Thank you.
     
     
STAFF REPORTS
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Staff reports on meetings, conferences, and seminars attended.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Several -- month or so ago, we -- I reported on a West Nile virus -- or a West Nile mosquito that was captured in the Kingston area through a -- a dead bird.  
     I've been working with Robin, our mosquito person, to -- to have that --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Gray.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- take -- Gray.  Thank you.  Robin Gray.
     They've been in the area.  They've collected samples.  They've done some ground spraying.  They've collected more samples.  
     It's been -- there's been a significant reduction in the number of mosquitoes that they've found with West Nile virus.  
     They did another test middle of this week.  And I have not received the report back from Robin yet as to whether or not they've taken care of the problem.  
     But they did a lot of ground spraying in the Gillman area.  Austin came back with no mosquitoes, as well as Kingston.  It seems it was -- it was centered in the Gillman area.  So that's the area we're concentrating on right now.  
     We did interviews for HR yesterday.  I will have that to you at the next meeting.
     Yesterday I put out a memo that I was going to suspend all credit card usage in the county effective at 5:00 o'clock this evening.  That problem was taken care of.
     I received a call from our treasurer last night at about 7:00 o'clock.  We have taken care -- or he has taken care of that -- that issue.
     So I'll follow it up with a memo that says credit cards could be used regularly by Lander County.
     I spoke with Tom Lemenager on airport issues in Austin.  That -- that project is completed with the tie-downs and the -- the pavement.
     We'll continue to work on some projects -- or on our five-year plan.  And they will be at the next meeting to give a complete update.  
     As -- as you're well aware of the fires that are going on within the state, within the western United States.  Our airport has been very busy flying air tankers.  They were flying again yesterday.  They had a 500-acre-plus fire.  It's going south of Crescent City.  You could see the column of smoke from here.  It was pretty impressive.  So it's probably a lot more than 500 acres by now.
     But airport's been very busy with air tankers this summer, which is good for us revenue-wise and not firewise.
     I have some other things that -- to do with the courthouse.  And I will report on that when we get to that agenda item.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Thank you.
     
     
PUBLIC COMMENT 
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Move to public comment for nonagendized items only.
     Persons are invited to submit comment in writing and/or attend and make comments on any nonagenda item at the board meeting, if any, and discussion of those comments at the discretion of the board.  All public comment may be limited to three minutes per person, again at the discretion of the board.  Reasonable restrictions may be placed upon public comment based upon time, place, and manner, but public comment based upon viewpoint may not be restricted.
     Do we have any public comment?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  We'll move into consent agenda.
     
     
CONSENT AGENDA
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All matters listed under the consent agenda are considered routine and may be acted upon by the Board of County Commissioners with one action, without extensive discussion.  Any member of the board or any citizen may request that an item be taken from the consent agenda, discussed, and acted upon separately during the meeting.  Consent agenda materials are available at the Lander County Clerk's Office for viewing, and copies are available for a nominal charge.
     One, approval of agenda notice, September 14th, 2017; two, approval of August 10, 2017, meeting minutes; three, approval of August 24, 2017, meeting minutes; four, approval of the payment of bills; five, approval of payroll change requests.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Need to take out number three.  Is there anything else anyone else wants taken out?
     Okay.
     With that, I'll make a motion to approve the agenda notice, September 14th, 2017; August 10th, 2017, meeting minutes; payment of the bills; and payroll change requests.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Second.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Sean's made a motion.  Art's seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?  
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
     
     
COMMISSIONERS
     
1)	Update from the Old Courthouse Committee and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Agenda Item Number 1.  Update from Old Courthouse Committee and all other matters properly related thereto.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Mr. Nelson could not make it today.  I received an email from him.  He's given me a brief update to read to -- to the commission to let you know what's going on.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  He did say he would be at the next meeting if we wanted him.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  He did say that.  That's correct.
     September 2017.
     A 501(c)(3) has been submitted for approval.  
     A regional historical architect toured the facility and discussed renovation and grants available at our most recent meeting.  
     Opened a bank account under the Nonprofit Lander County Citizens for Historical Preservation.  
     Established contact to Nevada Preservation Foundation.
     We have identified several grants we are qualified for and are assisting in the grant application process.
     Thank you for your continued support.  
     Colt Nelson.
     And like -- like Commissioner Bakker said, they're -- they will be available for our next meeting, if you'd like.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So they're moving forward, though, at least.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Sounds like it.  Yes.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, if they haven't done any -- any -- I mean, that's -- that's the best news.  Because that takes so long to do.  
     But I would say leave it up to him.  If there's something that they are doing that they can share with us, then put them on the agenda.  And if not, then there's no reason to have them come in.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I agree.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.
      
2)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the intrastate interlocal contract between the State of Nevada acting by and through its Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Community Health Services program, and Lander County, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Agenda Item Number 2.  Discussion for possible action to a- -- to approve/disapprove the intrastate interlocal contract between the State of Nevada acting by and through its Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health and Behavioral Health, Community Health Services program, and Lander County, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  This is the contract that will put Health and Human Services in the building at 825 North Second with the community health nurse.  A copy was provided to the DA's Office.
     And I'm not -- I -- I'm not sure.
     Ted?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Or is it this one?
     JEANNE FALZONE:  Uh-huh.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I have a question on the amounts.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  (Indiscernible.)
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.
     JEANNE FALZONE:  No.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  In the very back page where they list, like, our percentage that they -- that we pay of the whole total statewide and our individual.  It looks like $40,791.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  That's -- that's the basic cost.  And then the contract says, not to exceed --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- 91,000.  That would be the additional cost that we might incur if we had infectious outbreaks -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- and things like that.  It's a -- am I understanding that right?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You're -- you're absolutely correct.  That -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  This is -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- a standard contract.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  So regardless of what happens, if we had ten infection outbreaks or whatever or all this extra cost, it still wouldn't be more than the 91-.  That's what we're saying?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Correct.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Period.  Okay.  So it's absorbed somewhere else.  Okay.  Thank you.
     UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT:  (Indiscernible.)
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Huh?  
     UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT:  (Indiscernible.)
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  I -- I did review and approve this one.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That was going to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- be my question.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     I'll make a motion that we approve the intrastate interlocal contract between the Department of Health and Human Services Division of Healthcare Financing and Policy, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, and Lander County Social Services not to exceed $91,582.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'm sorry, (indiscernible).
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And authorize the chair to sign. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And this is for what?  One year?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Pardon me?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  One year? 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Two years.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  For two years.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah, I think it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And authorize the chair to sign.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Second.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Patsy made a motion.  Sean seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I -- I believe it has -- they -- they sent it with my name as the signator.  I can change it if you'd like.  They just have to send it.  And I'll have to change the last page.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Just amend it for the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  You could just -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- executive director to sign.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I'd rather not make any changes.  That'll delay everything.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll amend the motion to authorize our executive director to chair -- to chair -- to sign.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll amend my second.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Whoops.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  All those in favor of our amended motion?  
     Aye.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Thank you.
     
3)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the lease agreement between Four Corners Real Estate and Lander County for the airport hangar located at the Battle Mountain Airport, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item Number 3.  Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the lease agreement between Four Corners Real Estate and Lander County for the airport hangar located at the Battle Mountain Airport, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  This is the one that -- that we've been working on for quite a while -- the DA's Office has been working on for a quite a while.  And I think they had -- did get everything in order.  And we're ready to -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Isn't this for our REACH air ambulance -- Air Med?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  There -- there -- there were a lot of small problems in this in doing this contract up, not -- not insurmountable.  
     Square feet.  And they want more square feet and -- and things like that.  
     So we went through three or four weeks with -- of small changes.  And then -- then we reached a point where -- where it was acceptable to me.  And I hope it's acceptable to you now.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So what do you want as our effective date?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Pardon me?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  What do you want as our effective date?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I think they wanted to go back in time, didn't they?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I believe -- yes.  Yeah.  They wanted to go back to their original purchase date, which was, I believe, July.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  July.  I believe July.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  It -- it does say blank August in the lease.  And so I wanted to be sure we had it filled in properly.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  I think they're going back in time to the fis- -- start of the fiscal year.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Well, if is said August, then August 1st would be fine.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Oh. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I thought it was July, but it might -- may have been August.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I thought it was July.  But they're saying -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- this agreement made this blanket. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It came from them; right?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So okay.  Oh, so we -- and this is, again, for what?  Two years?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, it --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Part of -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- then -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- it came -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- then we need -- then we need -- we renegotiate.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  Part of it came from them.  And then I completely changed it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  So this is our contract with everything you guys wanted in it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, I mean, it is still pretty miniscule.  I mean, we're talking $360 a year.  Right?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Right?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  It -- it's basically for use of a hangar.  They get to move the hangar.  If -- if we cause anything, they -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- then we have to move it for them.  I mean, it's just basic.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Nothing's changed except the square footage.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Except their name, basically, and when they -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  It's for our air med; right?  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yes.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So in the motion, do they need July 1 as the effective date?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  August.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  August 1?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Uh-huh. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll make a motion to approve the lease agreement between Four Corners Real Estate and Lander County starting August 1st -- and authorize the chair to sign?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And you did say it was two years; right?
     Because I -- I didn't find that in there, but I might be -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, I -- I think that was one year.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I might have missed it somewhere.  So I wanted to be -- I thought we were discussing two years at one time.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  The two years is usually for the state for the -- the health nurse and the -- there's two state contracts that were --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I -- I thought we were discussing because it was an air med and they were coming in to change some things.  But -- but I didn't see it in the contract.  So I just wanted to be sure on record what we have.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'm -- I'm pretty sure.  I don't have it in front of me.  But I'm pretty sure it was one year.  What do you think?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I -- I just noticed it.  But I might have missed it.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I thought it was two.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah, I didn't see it in there anywhere.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Do we have a copy of it?
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  It's on the front page.  Sadie Sullivan, for the record.  Is it the fourth paragraph or third?
     UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT:  It should be in the packet. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  For a period of two-year lease term.  Right there.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Is that what you 	have? 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  It is a two-year?  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  It's on the front page.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yep.  It does.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  I thought it was two.
     JEANNE FALZONE:  Two years.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It's two years.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Do we have a second to the motion?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll second the motion.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Sean made a motion.  Patsy seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
4)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the lease agreement between Lander County and State of Nevada, Department of Administration, Public Works Division, for and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Rural Clinics for the lease of property located at 825 North Second Street, Battle Mountain, Nevada, and all other matters properly related thereto.
      
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item Number 4.  	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the lease agreement between Lander County and State of Nevada, Department of Administration, Public Works Division, for and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health and Behavioral Health, Rural Health Clinics for the lease of the property located at 825 North Second Street, Battle Mountain, Nevada, and all other matters properly related -- related thereto.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  This is the third entity, state entity that will be in the building.  That was the whole idea behind -- behind -- the state wanted was that all of these entities be within the same building for services.
     So this is just a -- another -- the -- the third and final entity that will be involved in the -- the building at twe- -- 825 Second Str- -- North Second.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Now you -- you approved this already.  You didn't approve this contract.  You approved them.  And then they changed the contract.
     And so I had to go through all the changes.  And you'll notice in your packet, there -- there are some notes from the district attorney regarding lease agreements with the state.
     And I'll read those into the record.
     It says, please pay close attention.  This lease gives the state one option to renew if notice is given 90 days prior to the expiration of the lease.  
     We couldn't change that.  So it's in there.  And it goes against what we usually put in our contracts.
     Number 2, the price per square foot shall be renegotiated if in fact they take advantage of the extension.  So at least we get that.
     Number 3, state has right to assign or sublease this lease  to any individual entity.
     County would need to approve in writing but not unreasonably with co-consent.
     That's legal gobbledygook.
     And I just wanted to point out to you that it's in there.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.
     I just needed a clarification on -- on one of the items.  And that's in number six it talks about utilities and services.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And it says, unless specified to the contrary in Section 6.3 below, the lessor shall provide and pay for the following:  gas, water, sewer, electricity, hot and cold water, and so forth.  Okay.  And then when you flip over to 6.3, it does say, tenant shall pay for the following utilities to service the de- -- the demised premises:  gas and electricity.
     So my question was -- okay -- it appears they're paying their own electricity now.  We are not.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That was the -- the agreement.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Right.  But the gas.  Is gas their fuel?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  No.  I believe it's talking about natural gas.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah, it would be -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Is gas a -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah, it would be their -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- the -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  It would be the -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- a --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- gas.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- burner?  I mean, I -- I don't know.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  For their heater.  Gas -- propane or natural gas is -- is what that is referring to.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It is propane?  I don't -- 
     So that is their heat?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So they are paying for their heat?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  They're paying for all the utilities.  That is correct.  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It -- it doesn't say that, but that's -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- that's the -- the two most important parts, electricity and -- 
     Doesn't say they're paying for water.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  It does on 6.1, like you pointed out, that we do.  Unless it's specified contract.  So there's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  Unless specified bel- -- unless specified below, we pay gas, water, sewer, and electricity.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And they specified below -- below that they pay for gas and electricity.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Right.  So that means we pay for the water.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.  Yes, ma'am.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  That's -- that's what I'm checking.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So we do.  They're not paying for all the utilities?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  They're only paying for gas and electricity.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  
     And sanitation pickup?  We pay for that too.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'm sure we do.  We have to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- provide them with parking space.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  That, I -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  What's the other -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- know.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- two -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  That doesn't cost -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- buildings -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- me extra -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- go with, Keith?  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- money.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  What's the UNR building and the ag extension office do?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  We -- in the past we've always shared the cost of the utilities -- or of the -- the trash pickup with -- with both entities.  Because we all use the dumpster.  Or we all used the dumper in the back.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.  
     Okay.  With that -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  We have a motion somewhere in there?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll make a motion to approve the lease agreement between Lander County and the State of Nevada, Department of Administration, Public Works Division, for and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Service Division and Public and Behavioral Health, Rural Clinics for the lease of the property located at 825 North Second Street, Battle Mountain, Nevada, and authorize the chair to sign.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No, it's Keith.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Keith.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Or authorize Keith to sign.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I can have that changed if you'd like.
     It's -- okay.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll second the motion.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Sean made a motion and Patsy seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
     
5)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the creation of a dog park, to choose a location, and to consider the change in ordinance in order for the project to move forward, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item 5.  Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the creation of a dog park, to choose a location, and to consider the change in ordinance in order for the project to move forward, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  So at our last meeting when we discussed this, we -- it was asked that you take a look at some areas and make some suggestions.  And so that's why it's back on to see what -- if we want to go with the area -- the original area we spoke of, change it, change the ordinance, or kill the project.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Have you contacted animal control for their input?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I have not, myself.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I -- I didn't -- I didn't even know which way we were going to go with it.  Once we do, I'll certainly sit down with the sheriff or undersheriff and we'll have a discussion.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, Sergeant Jones is here, if he has any -- 
     SERGEANT JOSEPH JONES:  No. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- comments on it.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I actually was -- I thought Ron might be here today, but -- 
     SERGEANT JOSEPH JONES:  He's running late, sir.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  Well -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Do you want to defer it until he gets here?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.  Why don't we do that?  And we could get a -- input, if that's okay.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  He'll be here -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- today?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  We're -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I think that's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- expecting Ron to show up today sometime?   
     SERGEANT JOSEPH JONES:  I am.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  We'll defer Item Number 5.  
     So somebody -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- somebody --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- remind us to get back to that one.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Excuse me.  Mr. Chair.
     But Ron's been here every time.  And -- and he hasn't had any input on it.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Well --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And he probably won't.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  We've never asked him directly, though.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Have we? 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's right.  You never asked him directly.  And I've made mention that this is an ordinance that has to be enforced by the sheriff's office.  They should be part of it.  Absolutely.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  The enforcement from the sheriff's office is that if they let their dogs loose, then they get cited.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  For dog at large.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  The dog park is going to remedy that.  They don't have to cite at the dog park.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's right.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  We hope it's going to remedy it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, if they let them run over the whole park then they do their regular thing.  
     So I don't know why that causes any more for them.  I don't understand the deferment.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It doesn't.
     No more law enforcement.  No.  It -- it -- it wouldn't.
     The -- any -- any change in the ordinance would not be police power state.  It would be more like regulatory things and where we build through the specifications, the -- the hours of operation.
     But I -- I don't anticipate any law enforcement issues.  And I don't mind you talking to Ron and asking Ron his insights.  I'm just pointing out that -- that they're not criminal statutes that we're going to be looking at.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  They're civil.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  They're regulatory.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  They're you guys.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  All you guys.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So do we still want to defer it?  Or can we go ahead?  It's been on the agenda several times.  Are we ready to make -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's true.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- any kind of decision?  We certainly can ask his input with the hours or anything that he might see that, --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- you know, he might have a --  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  This isn't -- this probably will not be the last time this comes before us either.  So there'll be plenty of opportunity for more input.
     So let's go ahead and discuss it, then.
     So I'll just say, I've been over to -- I guess it's Elquist Park is the one we've talked about putting a dog park in?
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  On -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Lions.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Lions. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Lions Park.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Lions. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's the one.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Elquist was the no.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's right.  So went over to Lions Park, looked at the area we plan on putting it in.  I kind of paced it off to get the -- the dimensions.  And I'm pretty content with having it in that -- would it be the northeast corner of that park?  There along where the -- next to the horseshoe pits?  Looks like a good area.  There's plenty of space there for a dog to run around.  I think it's -- I think that's a good spot.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I think our Public Works and our executive director brought us the information last time with how many feet, a hundred -- a hundred and fifty feet or whatever, that we had to do.
     And I did the same thing.  I went over and looked.  And I think it would be a -- a nice -- a nice area for them.  It's certainly large enough for -- for the dogs that we will have running.  And I think we need to keep it in town.  That was the request.  We don't want to move them out of town somewhere.
     And -- and I -- I think it would be an excellent contribution to the town.  
     Also, for even folks that are visiting, for our motels to know.  Yes, we have a dog park.  Because they allow dogs.  And you can run your dog.  And when they're traveling, they always like to turn their dogs loose and let them run too, besides our local people.  
     So I -- I think that that would be the area.  And I don't think that would take away from anything.
     And like Commissioner Mills said, some of the big events that we have, that corner isn't even being utilized at all.  So I don't think it's taking away from our citizens in -- in any way.  And I think it's large enough to throw a Frisbee and large enough to throw your ball and let your dog run.  And so I think that Lions would be the -- the area I'd like to see it in.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I'm still opposed to Lions Park.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  What -- if -- if I may, what -- which park or what areas or --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  People do use Lions Park.  And as I've stated before, there -- I have gotten public comment from the residents around the area in -- in opposition to it.
     The park is used.  They utilize the entire park for the Easter egg hunt for the little kids.
     It's a small park to start with.  And you start cutting sections out of it and it's -- it's kind of getting forgotten as a park for the citizens.
     If you're looking at an area, Borealis is -- is considerably larger and would offer the opportunity to make a larger area for the -- the dogs to run.
     I'm just very much opposed to Lions Park.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I think the key is that people still take their dogs there and -- and they do still walk them, whether they turn them loose and get a citation or not is -- is a different matter.  
     But -- but the point is, they're still walking them there.  And with the dog park, you certainly at least will have the cleanup afterwards.  And we'll have the f- -- the facilities and stuff for them and the notices for them to do that.
     Unfortunately, when I was there, there was still areas that the dogs had been and they did not bother to clean up after them.
     So I -- I think that would be good.  I don't worry about them with the -- with children so much, because they're turned loose in a separate area, as I do with them turning them loose now where. there's no area and the kids are there.  We've had some of those problems.  And I think that's awful.
     So -- 
     And -- and I'm sorry if -- if there's people that are going to be certainly not in favor of that.  But on the other hand, we've had it on the agenda two or three times.  And -- and nobody has spoke up on our public comment that they --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Would you like -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- they didn't -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- to open it for public comment?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Sure.
     Let's open it up to public comment.  What do you guys think?
     (No comment.)
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll make a motion --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Well, that makes it easier.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll make a motion that we -- we continue the discussion of putting a dog park in the area that we discussed in Lion Park.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Continue the discussion?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, the discussion would be how we're going to do the ordinance and what it's going to say and what it's going to do.  So I could use another word.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Are we choosing a location?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yes.  Lions -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Oh, okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- Park.  Yeah.  And then we continue -- we continue -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  How about -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- what is necessary to --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  How about you choose the location in your motion and then that you direct the appropriate agencies to do further research on square footage and -- and things of that nature?
     And --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So moved.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- changes to --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Do we have a second?
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.  I'll second it.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Patsy made a motion.  Art seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment now?
     (No comment.)
     All right.  All in favor?
     Aye.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Opposed?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Nay.

     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item Number 6.  Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the closure of the east end of West Humboldt, north end of Palmer Street, north end of Watt Street, north end of Stone Avenue, and west end of Burns Road adjoining Broyles Ranch Road for the annual Battle Mountain flu POD, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     Kerry, you're -- help us out with this one?
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Sure.  Kerry Tuckett.
     Just this is for the flu POD.  And this is something that we've done the last two years.  And this is to control the traffic in and around the flu POD so that we can maintain order and safety in -- in providing this to our citizens.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So you're doing the flu POD actually inside the ambulance bay again? 
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yes.  The vaccinations will be given in the ambulance bay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  With that, I'll make a motion to approve the closure of the east end of West Humboldt, north end of Palmer Street, north end of Watts Street, north end of Stone Avenue, and west end of Burns Road adjoining Broyles Ranch Road for the annual Battle Mountain flu POD.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We might -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- want to put the date.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I was just thinking that.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah, let's -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  When are you doing that?  
     KERRY TUCKETT:  It's October 13th.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  On October 13th.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Second.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It said the 12th in our -- 
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Oh, is it -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- information.
     KERRY TUCKETT:  -- the 12th?  Sorry.  It could be the 12th. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  October 12th.  
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yeah.  October 12th. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And authorize the chair to sign.
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yep.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll second the motion.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Art actually did.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Oh.  Art seconded?
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.  That's fine.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Sean made a motion.  Art seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.  
     Now will you give pneumonia shots and other shots?  Or is this strictly flu?
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Strictly flu.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Do you --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  And you track these; right?
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Because I got my -- my flu shot and pneumonia shot.  And they had every immunization that I've ever had. 
     KERRY TUCKETT:  There is -- so I don't know that they're tracked that way.  But I do know there is an awful lot of paperwork.  And everybody that comes through has to fill out a form --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.  And that -- 
     KERRY TUCKETT:  -- for that --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- form is tracked by the state.  
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yeah. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Every immunization that I've ever had is -- is tracked by the state since I moved here in '72.
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Kind of --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Do you -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- kind of interesting.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- have a date for Austin yet?  
     KERRY TUCKETT:  I don't.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  
     KERRY TUCKETT:  That's out of my control.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Just wondered.  Thank you.
     KERRY TUCKETT:  You'll have to get with Abby on that one.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.  Thank you, Kerry.  
     KERRY TUCKETT:  All right.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Thank you.
     KERRY TUCKETT:  Thank you.
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
PLANNING
     
7)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove a zone change request by Mount Lewis, LLC, for property (APN 002-320-12) located on Mount Lewis Drive, Battle Mountain, Parcel B Bowen Map, recorded 03-11-2016 as file number 0275405, to change zoning from R-4/C-2 (General Commercial/Multifamily Residential) to R-3 (Single-Family Residential 1/2-acre minimum), and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item Number 7.  Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove a zone -- a zone change request by Mount Lewis, LLC, for property APN 002-0 -- or -320-12 located on Mount Lewis Drive, Battle Mountain, Parcel B Bowen Map, recorded 3/11/2016 as file number 0275405, to change zoning from R-4/C-2, general commercial, slash, utility family residential, to R-3, single-family residential half-acre minimum, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     So I understand there's some issues with this one.
     How you doing?
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Very well.  Good morning.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Good morning.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Good morning.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Good morning.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Get you to state to your name for the record, please? 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes.  Robert Branstad.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Robert.  Okay.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  And member of Mount Lewis, LLC.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Have a seat.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Oh.  Thank you.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So we learned -- or I learned this morning that there may be some issues with this pertaining to some state zoning requirements that have not been met?  Are you aware of any --
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Not that I'm -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- problems -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  -- aware of.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- along those lines?  
     KYLA BRIGHT:  At this moment.  But it's just the zone change.  Kyla Bright, --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     KYLA BRIGHT:  -- planning coordinator, for the record.  
     But as you see in your packet, you know, just information.  Because they were kind enough to be give their master plan moving forward.  
     With the half-acre zoning and not having sewer in that area there are the -- 
     Let me see in our packet.  
     It has -- NAC requires a tentative map submission in order to allow density of half- -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Who is -- 
     KYLA BRIGHT:  -- acres.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- that? 
     KYLA BRIGHT:  So --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Huh?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Who is that?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Kyla.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Oh.
     KYLA BRIGHT:  Also you'll see with us just in our -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Did she -- 
     KYLA BRIGHT:  -- master plan code -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- identify herself?  
     KYLA BRIGHT:  -- that it also -- lot sizes where gross density exceeds -- I'm sorry.  That's the wrong part here.  Excuse me.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  She's ours.  
     KYLA BRIGHT:  I got to get this in front of me here.
     Well, in the master plan, it -- it says minimum of 2.5 acres if munic- -- municipal water and sewer service is not available unless a subdivision map is -- is filed.
     So those are just notes that I put in there for you guys to look for in -- in the subsequent parceling.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But the -- 
     KYLA BRIGHT:  So...
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- planning commission was okay with everything.  
     KYLA BRIGHT:  The planning commission did approve the zone change.
     Zone change can bring it down to the half-acre lots minimum.  And really going forward with their choices of mapping, whether it be parcel map -- mapping, subdivision, that's -- that's what needs to be in consideration.  
     A zone change really fits in the master plan, things of that sort.  
     However, like I said, going forward with their choice in mapping is -- is what needs to be considered.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So is there water and sewer out to this?
     KYLA BRIGHT:  There is water.  There is not sewer.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  There's no sewer.  
     KYLA BRIGHT:  So you're looking possibly at an addition of 13 septics on a 7-acre parcel.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  And how many lots will we have?  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Thirteen.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thirteen.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Thirteen.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  On 70 acres?  Is that what you just said?
     KYLA BRIGHT:  Seven.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Seven.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Seven.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yeah.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Mr. Branstad?
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes, ma'am.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So this is -- this would be directly across the street from the existing homes on Mount -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- Lewis --
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- now?  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay. 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  So basically.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Right.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Right over the -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And those are all half-acre lots.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes, -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Do you know? 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  -- they are.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  And all on septic as well.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And -- and what -- what do you have plans for the extra amounts that -- that were left over?  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Well, there really aren't any leftovers.  Thirteen half-acre lots translates into seven acres.
     There's one -- there's one lot that is -- has a little extra square footage beyond the half-acre.  But...
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  Must be the other one that has all the extra then.
     Because there's one -- yeah.  There's one in there that we looked at that was way extra, I know.  And I thought, I wonder what they're going to do with that.
     Okay.  So you're okay with that.  And -- and we can put septic on half acres.  So everything's cool.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yep.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Can -- can we get some clarification?  Because, again, I heard this morning there's a problem with the way the state requires zoning, that --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  In my -- in --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- we're not really following.  Can we get some clarification on that? 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  My discussions with Rex Massey, we felt that it didn't fall into what the state was looking for.
     And during that discussion, when you came in, Commissioner Bakker, we're making some -- some changes to the master plan to make things much clearer.
     We're -- we're -- we're getting rid of the some of the gray areas within the master plan in order to, like I say, make things easier to understand and clearer for both the planning commission and the commission.
     Not to derail your project, -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Uh-huh. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- but my recommendation -- or my request would be that we defer this until we have a clear, concise master plan in the county, which Rex is working on.  And drafts should be out four to six weeks for the planning commission to review and the district attorney to review prior to coming to you for final -- and you to review and then a final approval by you.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Comes down to basically water versus septic.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Is that what -- is -- is that part of -- because I'm still not clear about what the -- is -- is our master plan not matching up with what the state wants?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It's ambiguous.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Or where -- where -- where is the state?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It allows water in -- in some parts.
     It recommends water and then allows septic.  So it's an ambiguity.  It's a gray area, as Keith points out.  
     It recommends against septic.  And then it says you can put septic.
     That is a change that needs to be fixed so that it can give the planning commission and this commission a little more direction.
     And then it would -- would have to be fixed by ordinance.  And we talked to Mr. Massey about that.  And he's one hundred percent behind that.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  The -- the confusing part, first of all, the -- the time frame.  By -- by the time we do that and -- and redo a whole master plan and -- and still do what we're talking, a long, long time for, you know, our developers to wait.  
     But I can't see how that would change anything where we couldn't do half-acre lots.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I just don't --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It would -- it would change things since we're going to be in a water right litigation lawsuit that is going to impact this severely.
     If we put water out there, then we are putting --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  There's water out -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- our water -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- there, is there not?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- to -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes, there is.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  There is -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  There's water out -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- water.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- there.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  There -- there's water and -- yeah. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No sewer. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  There's no sewer.  But what -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  There's no sewer.  So I don't know how that would impact it.  What I'm saying is I don't understand -- 
     Now, if there wasn't water, I -- I would understand that.  And maybe we'd have to stop all development.  That's happened, you, know, in different communities and -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We have to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- such.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- develop beneficial use to protect -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Right.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- our water rights.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But -- but with water there and with the developer ready to go and -- and, I mean, we're just authorizing the zone change with some additional septics.  And I can't see that 13 septics are going to be changed under a master plan.  I just -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I don't know how you can have -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Isn't the -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- a -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- isn't the master plan -- plan pretty clear when it says, "should not develop until municipal utilities are available"?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the water -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- been -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- and sewer.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- that's been my -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Water and -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- argument with all of these rezoning things way out there.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's the recommendation I'm talking about.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right.  Right.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And that's what needs to be fixed.  We need to fix the master plan in preparation for our -- for the -- the lawsuit with the -- with Lovelock and the state.
     And so we -- if anything needs to be prioritized, it's -- it's our master plan.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So I do have a question about the rezoning.  And I may need clarification on this.  
     Anything five -- or more than four parcels -- so if you go five par- -- parcels or more would constitute a subdivision and falls into certain requirements.
     And I know this is on an existing road already.  But isn't that still basically we're creating another subdivision?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes, we are.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's been -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- the argument that I've proposed many times with this issue.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So basically we're looking at, you know, curb and gutter, street lights --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, that's not part of the package.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well, but that's -- it's --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It should be.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Isn't that -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- part of the subdivision?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It should be, Judie.  Yes.  I agree.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But I thought -- I thought it was.  And, like I said, maybe I'm -- I'm confused or misinformed on that.  But I thought, in a subdivision in our ordinances it states that, you know, if you have this many parcels and you technically are creating a subdivision, then you are required to --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  But -- but as they pointed out to you, there's an ambiguity.  He can create a subdivision or not.
     And if he chooses not to, those requirements don't have to be met.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But if he's going down to 13 lots --
     KYLA BRIGHT:  However, that you -- the commission and the planning commission in subsequent parceling have the right to make those requirements on his parceling.
     So if he comes in -- his first map has four parcels -- within that 365 days, he brings another one, you guys can say, we are requiring a cul-de-sac.  We're requiring -- requiring curb, gutter, sidewalk.  You guys place those requirements upon him.  You can treat it as a subdivision.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Now the last --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Because he still has to bring back the parcel maps.  And he's still got to approve --
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Correct. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  And that -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  This is just zone -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- that was my -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- change.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- question, is -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So we're just -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- is --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- we're just doing a zone -- 
     KYLA BRIGHT:  It's just the zone change. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- thing.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yes.
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Then that was just -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Now --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I mean, he -- you'll still -- he'll bring back a mylar that the planning commission will have approved that you're going to have to sign or whoever's chair at the time.  And that's where you put your stipulations you want curb and gutter, lights, -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Correct. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- so on and so forth.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yeah. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So that -- that.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  And like -- and if I may speak, that also solves the problem with the master plan and the ambiguity with the state because the first map would only have three potential homes on it.
     So it's not like you're approving 13 new septics right at this moment.
     As Kyla said, you're just -- we're just asking for a change in the zoning so we can create the map to bring to you.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah.  Because if you don't change the zoning, they're not going to create the mylar -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  No. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- and spend the time to do it.
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.  And it says map one will consist of three half-acre parcels and one remainder parcel is 5.5 acres.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yes, ma'am. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  That's what I was asking you.  What are you planning to do with the balance?
     That was my -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Oh, I'm sorry.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- question.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  I meant -- excuse me.  I mis- -- I totally misunderstood the -- the intent of your question.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Oh.  Oh.
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  So yes. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I wasn't clear, then.  I'm sorry.  
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yeah.  No, no.  I -- when -- when I was -- the -- the net result of dividing seven by 13 is obviously greater than a half.
     And so that's -- that was the question that I was answering.  
     As far as the remainder five and a half, that would be for future development, another map down the road.
     I mean, we --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  I thought maybe you were going to -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  We -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- do a park or something.  That's why -- that's why -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Maybe a dog park.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- I was --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right?  There you go.
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Solve all the problems.  No.
     Obviously we can't really forecast how the sales will go.
     I mean, my experience in Lander as well as Humboldt and Elko is it takes a while.
     So, you know, we're not asking for the world --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I thought it might have been -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  -- right now. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- on the plans.  That --
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  We're just looking for three -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- that's all. 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  -- little lots. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I didn't mean to put you on the spot.  But I thought --
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  That's okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- you were going to say, -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  And I -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- you know, like -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  -- and I have no problem explaining it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, I think we need to consider Keith's comment about deferring this.
     I think there's some issues that need to be resolved.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I agree.  But I think if we approve this today, we can meet the comments or the worries when we do the mylar.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So in future steps in the process. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  There are.  And -- and I -- I have a -- a tough time when -- when they come in and say, you know we're -- we're ready to do something and this is economic growth and we need it, for us to say, well, let's just wait.  And we don't know how long we're going to have them wait.  So it's an ongoing process that I think we'll have input on along the way.  So I -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Do -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- agree.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  we have a shortage of homes or spaces to build homes?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Right-priced homes.  Sure.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I didn't know we were in a space crunch or -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Well -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- rental crunch.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Well, I think, Art, if we approve this then we can start the process on making sure there's water and sewer, --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- curb and gutter.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  This -- and this also lets you be aware that we're concerned about some of these issues -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yeah. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- and taking care of them.
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  And then -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  As a developer, you'll be aware that these are some of the issues -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Right. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- we're looking at.
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Yeah.  And it's very understandable.  I -- this is not a comment directed at staff or the commission.
     I've been involved with this parcel now for almost four years.
     The original owners getting it subdivided just to peel this part off from the larger section, getting the former owners all signed off and so forth.  
     So it does take some time, which is why, you know, once again, I'm asking that we just incrementally advance the ball so we can take the next step.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well, I think this is a -- a good opportunity.  It's -- it's moving some future development in a little bit new area, you know.  It's -- it's existing old -- old homes there already.  But it's bringing new homes to a new area -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Uh-huh. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- as opposed to, you know, further growth to the south and west.  
     And we always need land.
     People moving in always want to have the option of -- of looking at their options of where they want to live.  And this is relatively close to town, convenient.  And I have no problem with, you know, developers doing what they want with their property within the boundaries of what -- 
     ROBERT BRANSTAD:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- are in the codes.
     So I don't feel that we should be sitting up here and saying, you know, taking our personal opinions into view and saying, no you can't do it.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Ted, if we approve this today, can we put restrictions on it as they come in?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Absolutely.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That's the idea.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  We can?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And then we can start -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- developing.  I mean.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And you can stop the projects.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  We can?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Oh, yes.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'm going to make a motion -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Well, Lana, did you have a comment?  
     LANA MELVER:  I do.  Lana Melver.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Will you come up so our -- so the microphones will pick up -- 
     LANA MELVER:  Oh, sure. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- your voice? 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And the cameras.
     LANA MELVER:  Lana Melver.  
     I just want -- I realize we're here for a zone change today, but kind of want to paint a picture in your mind that this development on Mount Lewis would actually mirror what's across the street.
     So it's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     LANA MELVER:  -- pretty rural development out there.
     I don't know of a sidewalk, curb, gutter, or anything on Sheep Creek, Mount Lewis, Blossom Springs, anything, even Mulligan for that matter.  
     So just keep in mind as we go forward is that we're hoping to, again, mirror the opposite side of -- of Mount Lewis and just give Battle Mountain some new construction to choose from as they look at home options.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Thank you.
     Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Make a motion to approve the zone change request by Mount Lewis, LLC, for property APN 002-320-12, located on Mount Lewis Drive, Battle Mountain, Parcel B Bowen Map, recorded 03-11-2016 as file number 0275405, to change zoning from R-4/C-2, general commercial, multifamily residential, to R-3, single-family residential, half-acre minimum.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I'll second that.

     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the fiscal officer job description, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  This is actually the job description that was approved by you last -- last year when the previous finance director at the time left.
     It was never approved and -- well, it was approved, but I want to get it actually signed and if we need to put it into the code or however we need to do this.  Because the fiscal officer is actually in the code.
     So this is the one that was approved last year right after the -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  The chair needs to sign?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  Please.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll make a motion to approve the fiscal officer job description and authorize the chair to sign.

     How randomly?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Just -- as -- when the time sheets come in, if -- if -- just for audit purposes is more what it -- what it has to do with.
     It could be once a pay period.  It might not be once every three months.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Oh, this is an audit requirement to --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- ren- --- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  It's just for audit purposes to make sure that -- that time sheets are being done properly and signed and -- and so forth.

12)	Discussion for possible action regarding the 2 percent merit increase and step-in-grade promotion procedures.  The 2 percent merit increase was approved at the Lander County Commission meeting of April 27, 2017, in which the commission voted on and adopted a motion to approve the addition of language to the county policies and procedures to allow Lander County employees to receive a merit increase of up to 2 percent on their anniversary date upon completion of a successful evaluation being done by the elected official, department head and/or supervisor and a merit request form being submitted to the commissioners at a meeting.  The question for this commission to decide is whether Lander County employees are eligible for both the merit increase and the step-in-grade promotion on their anniversary date.
     
     Item Number 12.  Discussion for possible action regarding the 2 percent merit increase and step-in-grade promotion procedures.  The 2 percent merit increase was approved by the Lander County Commission meeting, April 27, 2017, in which the commission voted on and adopted a motion to approve the addition of language to the county policies and procedures to allow Lander County employees to receive merit increases of up to 2 percent on their anniversary date upon completion of a successful evaluation being done by elected officials, department head and/or supervisor -- and/or supervisor and a merit request from -- form being submitted to the commissioners at a meeting.  The question for this commission to decide is whether Lander County employees are eligible for both the merit increase and the step-in-grade promotion on their anniversary date.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I think it should be -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- one or the other.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Isn't that what was discussed, though?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Seems like we discussed that.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You -- you discussed -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I know we got the meeting minutes along with this.  And it looked like that was discussed in there. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That -- that was a long discussion in -- in the previous minutes.
     And -- and an elected official was --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  What's the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- very adamant about it.  And so no decision was made as to whether -- 
     In the first discussion, it was the 2 percent that the union -- we negotiated with the --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Living -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- union --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- cost.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- and the merit.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  This is not the 2 percent.  This is just the merit and the step-in-grade.  
     Do you want to give both of them?  Because they both are due at the anniversary date, if -- if they pass everything.
     That's -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the question.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I believe it needs to be either the merit or the step-in-grade, but not both.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  The -- the CBA percentage is how much?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Two percent. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Two percent.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Two percent. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Annually.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.  And the -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  For the next -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- merit is 2 percent. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Up -- up to 2 percent. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Up to -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Up to --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- two --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- two.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- percent.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  Correct.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Guys?  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I'll -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- make a motion -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Guys. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- that we -- for clarification purposes, that it read a merit increase up to 2 percent on their anniversary date or a -- a step-in-grade promotion on their anniversary date.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But not both.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But not both.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  If -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- second that.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  If you have a CBA that says 2 percent for every person and the other raise is deemed a merit, are they both under the CBA?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We shouldn't be discussing the 2 percent that was negotiated.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  They are separate items.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  They're separate items.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.  So --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And it's not agendized.  This is --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  You -- you said --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  This is down to --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  You -- you said a few minutes ago that the CBA was 2 percent.  So I'm going off of that.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  No, it is.  But it -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- it was the issue --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So the merit -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- in the pre- -- in the -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Is the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- previous -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Is the merit part of the CBA?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, sir.  We are two totally separate issues:  merit increase and step-in-grade increase.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Has nothing to do with the 2 percent negotiation.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So the merit just comes from us.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Comes from -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the department head --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Through the --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- or elected official.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, we're making a decision right now whether or not it's one or both.  So...
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, you've made the decision that the merit -- that you will accept the merit.  And it's up to 2 percent.  
     And if -- if they succe- -- and you even put in the words "successfully passed".  If they successfully pass it and they give something to you, then that up to 2 percent will be approved.  You've already decided that the merit is in place, and it's going to be part of the policies and procedures.
     Today, you -- you need to say, well, that excludes the step-in-grade or that includes the step-in-grade or that's substituted by the step-in-grade.  And I can't think of any more options.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  What --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  Here's my -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- what -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- question.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  What had -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Oh. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- hap- -- what had happened is an elected official had put in an employee for a step-in-grade increase, at the same time put in for the 2 percent merit.
     So they were getting the step-in-grade, a promotion, and then they were also going to get the 2 percent and then they would get the negotiated.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  And I don't mean to bring it up, Ted. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, it's all right. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  But the negotiated was part of it too.  So there was some potential -- three different raises within a fairly short period of time.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Which is much higher than 6 percent. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And that was -- that was my question.  When somebody gets a step-in-grade, it isn't necessarily on their anniversary date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's when they're usually -- that's when they're usually tested for it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  When else would it be?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Well -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Somewhere throughout the year when they're saying, -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  But usually it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  No.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- you're really doing -- you're really doing more work than we -- than we expected you and -- to do.  And we need you over here.
     Or -- or John -- John Doe left.  So we're going to replace John.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's what --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And it's a step-in-grade.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  That's the exception.  But -- but usually --  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But could happen in the middle of the year.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It's usually on the end of it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It's usually anniversary.  That was my question.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, I think that merit's important.  I think that you have some people that work exceptionally hard.  And you have other people that work.  
     And I think that incentive in -- in the form of merit is important for those people that are achievers.  And they need to be rewarded.  
     I -- I think that we need to keep both out there.  And you keep that 2 percent carrot out there.  And it -- it makes people feel more appreciated and willing to work.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  It -- af- -- you're absolutely correct.  That -- but the real question is:  If a supervisor, director decides to give one of them, is that employee eligible for the other one at that time?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Because they've already given a promotion and a raise.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Isn't a promotion like -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So what you're saying, Art, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- a merit?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- is true.  But, I mean, if there's a year where they can't have a promotion, but they can have a merit raise. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And there will be a year where they can have a promotion and they don't get the merit raise. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But they're still getting a promotion and a raise. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  They still can get both of them.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  But not -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  The same -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- at the same -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- time.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- time.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I thought we discussed -- that was pretty --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, we didn't discuss this at the last --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- one.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So you can still get two and two.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You -- you can still get them, --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- if it's done right.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So we have a motion from Judie and a second from Sean.  Oh.
     Public -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And I don't -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- comment.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- know if -- yeah.  I don't know if you want public comment now or -- 
     I just wanted some clarification.  And some of it was cleared up, but I had a couple questions.  So whenever's the appropriate -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Would you state your name for the record.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Sadie Sullivan.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Thank you.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Thanks.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  She's testing -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Do you want me to go ahead -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- you.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- and -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I know.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Do you want me to go ahead and go -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Go ahead. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- now?  
     Okay.  So just to clarify where it has the step-in-grade promotion, that is your different levels.  So say it's a Executive Secretary 1 going to an Executive Secretary 2.  If you don't put that in your budget, you can't ask for that step-in-grade.
     So with my job descriptions for my different employees to be able to make those -- the criteria in my job descriptions or they have to be a part of the elections for a certain amount of years to go with those step-in-grades.  
     So there's been times that I haven't put in that step-in-grade promotion, but they still get their 2 percent of the union.  But there's also -- are you saying -- a 2 percent for the merit?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It's already -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Up to -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- in there.  They've already -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  It's already in there.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- voted on it.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So I do my annuals, they can get their 2 percent.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Okay.  I just wanted to make sure that was clarified. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  With an eval and every -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Right.  With -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- the evaluation, they can get their 2 percent.  But I'm not doing a step-in-grade because they haven't met those criterias.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Up to -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I think it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- 2 percent.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- important that we take the union out of the picture.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We need to.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That 2 percent, is -- it's there.  It's budgeted.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  We know it's there for the next three years.  It's out of the picture.  The up to 2 percent when -- when you do your evaluations is included in the budget.  That doesn't -- that doesn't mean you have to use it, though.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Right.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  This has to do with -- with -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Actual step-in- -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- giving somebody -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- -grade.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:   -- a raise --  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Correct.   
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- from a one to a two -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Okay. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- so they get that raise.  And then at the same time, are we going to give them an evaluation and say, well, you're going to get the rai- -- the raise from your Executive Secretary 1 to an Executive Secretary 2, which is whatever that amount is.
     And then we're going to give them an evaluation and give them another 2 percent on top of that.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That wasn't -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  At the same -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the intention, -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- time. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- though, -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  At --  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- I don't -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the same -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- think.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- time.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Pardon me?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That wasn't the intention.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  I don't think so.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No.  No.  It -- that -- but that's -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  It wasn't clear.  I understand, -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- but that was -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- not -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- that's the -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the intention.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- question, though.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  That's -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:   Are we going to do -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the question.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- that?  Are we -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- going to say, "You get a raise.  You get a 2 percent"?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  And -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- there's already a motion to -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Thank you -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- not do that.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- for the clarification.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I'm just -- I just want to make sure that the board understands -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- where we're -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Marla? 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- coming from.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Why don't you -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah, we need -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- come on -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- up.
     MARLA SAM:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  With this motion the way it -- it's been presented, you can still get the two and two.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can get everything.  But you can't get them both at the -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  At the same -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:   -- same time.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- time.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  At the same time.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  Judie was pretty clear.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  You cannot -- 
     MARLA SAM:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- get the merit and the step-in-grade at the same anniversary date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  But you can get the merit somewheres else through the year.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Merit's -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  No, not -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  No, that -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- within that -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- just -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- year.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- comes at your annual -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Not within that -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- evaluation.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- year.  
     MARLA SAM:  Okay.  Marla Sam, for the record.  
     Okay.  So you work really, really, really hard.  And you guys say, oh, my gosh, you guys, you're wonderful.  I'm going to get you 2 percent to everybody.  Everybody's going to get a 2 percent.  If you pass your evaluation, you get a 2 percent.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Up to.
     MARLA SAM:  You worked up to 2 percent or whatever.  And then you just happened to get a new job description, which requires that you get a raise.
     You've worked for that.  You've worked for that maybe five or ten years to get that.  That was something that you normally would get maybe in December.  Nobody would say anything.  
     Oh.  Yep.  Done.  Signed.  
     But because a person has -- gets a raise, and unfortunately her anniversary date is the next week or two or three, it's a no?
     But -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.
     MARLA SAM:  -- anybody else can get a -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It wouldn't -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- step-in-grade?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  It should all -- 
     MARLA SAM:  Is this -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- be done on the -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- what you're -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- anniversary -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- saying? 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- date.  So if you're getting a promotion, they should already know they're giving you a promotion and a -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- raise instead of -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It wouldn't -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the merit.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- be a no.  You'd be able to choose which one you wanted that particular year.  
     MARLA SAM:  But if I don't perform -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.
     MARLA SAM:  -- and get a merit, I'm getting a step-in-grade, which you're going to give to me without a problem because -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right. 
     MARLA SAM:  -- she said.  But if I get a merit, like everybody else doesn't have a step-in-grade that year, they get an automatic merit.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No one gets an automatic merit.
     MARLA SAM:  Well, they pr- -- all right.  They pass it.  They do their evaluation.  They get a merit.  And they get it.  What I'm not understanding, what's the problem?  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah. 
     MARLA SAM:  If I get -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Marla -- Marla -- there -- there's no -- we -- I just want clarification.  When I -- when I review a -- a -- a -- a -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Payroll change -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- payroll change request, I want to make sure that I'm not doing something that this board doesn't want me to do.
     It's whatever they want to do.  There's no sides here.
     MARLA SAM:  Well, no.  I'm -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I just want clarification --
     MARLA SAM:  -- just trying to -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- on what -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- understand.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- on how -- 
     MARLA SAM:  I'm just -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- you -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- trying to understand how come you can't get a promotion and still get a little bit of -- you passed your evaluation.  You're a good employee.  You've done well.  You've done fine.  We appreciate you.  But you've worked hard for both the merit and you've worked both for the step-in-grade.  Why can you not have -- I mean, if I got -- I -- I don't understand.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's the question.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Can I -- 
     MARLA SAM:  I mean, that's what I'm saying.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right. 
     MARLA SAM:  But, I mean, why would you be against that?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I know. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I -- I would like to comment.
     And I realize a lot of the petitions -- or positions do actually get step-in-grades outside of their anniversary dates.  That for whatever reason, at a certain time, you know, you get a step-in-grade.  
     And then again, you -- you kind of got to look at it in another perspective is -- okay -- it's your anniversary date.  You get your evaluation.  Okay.  You get your up to 2 percent merit increase.  
     So just rough numbers here.  Let's say, you know, you're making 20 bucks an hour and you get your 2 percent and -- and whatnot.  
     Well, then in six months, your supervisor decides to do a step-in-grade.
     Well, had you not got that merit increase, possibly the step-in-grade would have been 21 bucks an hour versus the 20.  So you did get your merit increase.  It still didn't put you over the 21.  You still would have been making more with your -- your step-in-grade.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Absolutely.  Every time.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So your step-in-grade, it's -- it's not like, you know, when you go up to a higher grade, typically you're not going to make less than what you were previously making.
     Now, one of the -- the factors in this is, you get -- you get a step-in-grade on your anniversary date.  You don't get the merit increase.  
     You get a step-in-grade after your anniversary date.  For whatever reason your next anniversary date comes along and you get your increase.  
     I mean, it all kind of works out.  It's just what we don't want is to say, Marla, you know, we're going to -- we're going to, you know, give you this step-in-grade and then give you 2 percent on top of that step-in-grade.
     MARLA SAM:  But what if you've earned it?
     I mean, you've earned that promotion.  And you've approved a 2 percent for everybody.  How can you say that? 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Up to 2 percent.  
     MARLA SAM:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And that's -- 
     MARLA SAM:  Up to 2 percent.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And but the thing is, is what you're doing is you're getting -- 
     MARLA SAM:  You're giving an employee that's worked very hard for many years -- and I'm sure that's everyone in here --  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Yes.  
     MARLA SAM:  -- that you are rewarding them for service.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Her job that --   
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But -- 
     MARLA SAM:   It's not like -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- you're rewarding -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- it's going to -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Her job, --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Marla.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- they're no longer going to have if they get a step-in-grade.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Marla, you're -- you're -- by getting a step-in-grade, -- 
     MARLA SAM:  I'm not getting it.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- you are getting rewarded.  
     MARLA SAM:  Okay.  I'm -- I'm done.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But I --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Marla.  Marla.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  What happens if you're not up for promotion, though, --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Marla. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- and there is no merit, then you -- then don't get anything.  The merit was supposed to be put in place for people who aren't up for promotions to reward those employees.
     MARLA SAM:  Is that what is stated in the -- in the original?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That was the idea behind it.  
     MARLA SAM:  Idea -- idea behind it. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yes. 
     MARLA SAM:  Is it stated as that?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, it's about to if they -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  It is now.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I believe so.  That -- that's what we -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But it was -- it was for the people who aren't getting promotions and raises to show that you -- we appreciate those employees.  And here's a merit increase.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And you may never get a step-in-grade.  And if -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- you do a long time.  But that was the intent.  
     So we want you to have a raise.  And that way if you're doing a good job, you're going to get either a step-in-grade or a merit or part of it.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But not both.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So with that --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  It's -- it's as clear to me as it is to you.
     MARLA SAM:  Thank you.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So with that, Sadie Sullivan -- 
     MARLA SAM:  I'm glad I'm not the only one up here. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  That's not the same -- Sadie Sullivan for the record -- for your -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  If it's -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- salaries, though.  Correct?
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  If it's -- if it's a merit.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Because your salaries don't go up the 2 percent.  So your salaries, they could get -- they could get a thousand that year.  They could get 5,000 that year.  They could get whatever on your salary people.  So -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Correct.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- that's a totally separate item than what this is.  So --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- when it says Lander County employees, that's -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  You need to take the -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- union -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- the nonexempt. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- employees.
     Yeah.  Not -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  You need to say nonexempt --
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- employees. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Somewhere it needs to be -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  In our motion.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:   -- clarified.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  In your motion.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Because this is for your exempt employees, for union employees.  But your others, your salaries, are nonunion.
     So -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  No, because you have some employees that are nonexempt that are not salary.
     So the motion needs to say non -- or are not part of the union.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Right.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  The motion -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  The non. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- needs to say nonexempt employees.  Exempt employees are the salary employees.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So we need to amend that for non- -- well.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah.  We'll need to amend the motion when we get to that.  
     Let's have -- Bert, make your comments.
     BERT RAMOS:  Bert Ramos, for the record. 
     The -- I'm a little off on the whole 2 percent.  
     I know we've talked on the -- on rewarding our employees.  And then I've also heard a lot of talk about us being top-heavy on salaries.  
     And one of the things that I've seen in the past seven, eight years is we've done big percentage raises to everybody.  And we've brought our lower employ- -- our new employees on at higher wages.  But in doing so, we've -- all of our employees that have spent 20 years with us are making the same as somebody that comes through the door the very first day.  
     So I think that these 2 percents and -- and adding percentage is -- I don't think it's the best option for the county, personally.  I think that they should go back to some sort of bonus system that can be removed if the county is top-heavy again, as opposed to something that we're stuck with no matter what happens.
     And -- and it also -- that -- that would give these employees that have 20 years of loyal service to this county something more than the guy that just walked through the door and is making the  same -- same salary as -- as him.  Because he's not getting -- he's not getting -- the step-in-grade isn't -- isn't a fair shake for the -- for the loyal employees of the county.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And I agree with Bert on that.  I've -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Mr. Chair. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- been in the county for quite a while.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.
     BERT RAMOS:  And I know -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And it's -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  -- that's off topic.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's not -- that's not the -- the topic here.  And I -- I apologize, Bert. 
     BERT RAMOS:  No, no.  I know. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  But that's not the topic here.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I'm looking -- or discussion.  We want clarification.  This is all we want.  Are we going to be able to give -- is somebody going to be able to get a step-in-grade, a promotion, as well as the 2 percent at the same time?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes, sir.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's the only question here.  The -- the -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Because that's what we budgeted for.  We can always change it during next budget.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  I just -- I just want -- we're just looking for clarification.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  You alm- -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Can they get both? 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  You almost have an answer.  We're about ready to vote.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.  We were getting off topic.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  We need to amend that for nonexempt, though, -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- please, Judie.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  For -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Actually I don't want to amend that for nonexempt.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Because, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it should be across the board for all employ- -- employees, whether they're salaried or hourly.
     So I know it's -- that doesn't necessarily come into play for your step-in-grade.  But -- so kind of makes a moot point in that.
     So I will not amend my motion.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Do you want to maintain -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Hold on.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Elizabeth Barela.  
     The difference with the salary ones is -- is -- is you can't cap them at the 2 percent because their -- their supervisors, if they want to give them -- 
     Salary is in a lump sum.
     So you -- you just don't say your salary people are going to get their 2 percent because if they want to give them -- or if they offered them a job at a salary position and then agreed to get them in six months a $2,000 raise, that's the difference with your salary and your nonexempt.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  Well, one thing this discusses is, you know, is the clarification.  Are they going to get the step-in-grade and the merit increase at the same time?
     That's what the discussion is.  And salaried employees don't have steps-in-grade.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Correct.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  But they're not getting it anyway.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Correct.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So that's a moot -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- it's a moot point.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- it's a moot -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So it's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- point.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- a moot point.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Well, but she just wanted clarification.  Because some people --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I didn't --
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- will come back and say, -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- okay.  Well, that -- that's just -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  The salary -- salary -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- the salary as well. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- people are all going to get the 2 percent no matter what.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  No, they don't.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  They don't -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So that's why -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- get it -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- I'm not amending -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- at all.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- my motion is because it is a -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  They get a -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- moot point. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- dollar figure.  They don't get a -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Because it's either a step-in-grade -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- percentage.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- or -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  They get larger -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- a merit and only salaried -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- than 2 percent.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  No.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- get the -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- step-in-grade.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  They get -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  The salaried -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- larger than -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- does not get -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- 2 percent, Doug.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- step-in-grade.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah.  I have no idea.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Sadie Sullivan, for the record.  I just wanted to make it clear so that way when we go and reference this back at budget time or in a year, ten years, whatever, that it's clear for the record.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Thanks for muddying the water, Sadie.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So after that clarification, can we get a clarification on what we just --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  A clarification of the clarification -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  You want a -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- before the -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- new motion? 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- clarification?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  You want a new motion?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  No.  I think it's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  No, I -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- clear, though.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- think our motion's clear.
     So what our motion is, is that we do not give a step-in-grade and a merit increase at the same --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Anniversary date.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- anniversary date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  In the same year.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And that's pretty clear.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  In the same year, really.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  But now we're -- we've got to understand how we're applying that and what it -- and what that means, if we -- when we put that in place.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, it -- it applies to all applicable employees.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I mean, it -- it's already set in -- in -- in stone on who it doesn't apply to.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  
     And I think that should be fairly clear.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It is fairly clear.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But it doesn't say anything about the same year.  It simply says, on their anniversary date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, it's -- there's -- it takes a year to get to the next one.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I know.  But you kept saying within the same year.  And I kept saying, no, that's not what we're saying.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, if you put down on their anniversary date, that means that they're not eligible for it until the next anniversary date. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But there might be exceptions where they would have a step-in-grade.  That's what we're saying.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Not if you put it on their anniversary date.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Sadie Sullivan, for the record.  
     As an example, like Marla, say that 2 percent, it -- I think it states somewhere July.  But your -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's union.  The 2 percent in July --
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  No, no, no.  I'm not done.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- is union.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  The 2 percent -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Up to.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- for your up to -- your 2 percent for the increase.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Merit.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So -- merit.  So if you did that in July and your person came on, their anniversary date is September, October, kind of like what Marla was saying, and then here you have that additional.  So it could happen in the same year.  And it has happened in -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- the same year.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- that's the point.  It -- the point is, should it happen in the same year?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  If it does, it -- it does.  But we're saying they can't have both on their anniversary date.  Period.  That's clear.  
     MARLA SAM:  So it can have it next month?  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Could.  Could happen.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Well, see, now there's -- there's -- we need more clarification is -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We may have a vacancy and they may go up.  
     MARLA SAM:  I mean, it just happens to be an anniversary date, unfortunately.  But -- so you get your step-in-grade.  In December 2 percent because you're wonderful.  So does that work?
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  It has in the past.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  It was for -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- a year period.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I agree with Marla.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I think -- I think one of the other things that needs to be mentioned is --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- everybody is assuming that it's a mandatory two percent, not mandatory, but --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  They're automatically -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- a 2 percent.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- going to get it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Automatic?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And one of the things that I would hope in -- in, you know, the spirit of all this is that your department heads use their common sense and realize that, okay, so let's say your anniversary date's in October.  Sometime February you get a step-in-grade.
     Okay.  So now you've already gotten your increase, your raise.
     Okay.  Here comes your anniversary date in October.  And your department head feels that you are entitled to a merit.  Well, that person has up to 2 percent.  But let's be a little reasonable here, people.  As a department head you should be conscientious of -- of your budgets.  Maybe they give you a half a percent.  Is we cannot dictate a hundred percent every scenario possible.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  You can.  Because you approve it.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well, there going to be -- there's going to be ins and -- 
     MARLA SAM:  And there is -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- outs.  
     MARLA SAM:  -- money.  There is money in the budget.  It's been approved.  It's been all done.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Should she --
     MARLA SAM:  It's just a -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- be -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- matter of -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- identifying -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- looking -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- herself? 
     MARLA SAM:  -- ahead.  I don't under- -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You guys -- 
     MARLA SAM:  I understand what you're saying.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Hey, Marla, will you state your name.  
     MARLA SAM:  Marla Sam, for the record.  I've worked here for a long time.  And I finally -- finally after twenty -- on Saturday, 24 years with this county, I make almost, kind of sort of as much as somebody that you hired -- I might make a little bit more than them -- hired to do a clerk's job.
     Wow.  I'm so appreciated.  Thank you, all.
     I'm -- we're not asking for a huge amount.  I don't make that much money.  And I -- you know, and I work hard.  And everybody works hard.  And I don't -- I can't understand.  Forty cents? Really?
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, I think -- 
     MARLA SAM:  But I need to go salaried so I can get 10,000.  I'm in -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I think --
     MARLA SAM:  -- the wrong job.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I think that 2 percent -- if you've got a 2 percent merit increase that would actually reflect on your -- on your check.  If you got a .5 percent increase, you would have less money on your check because -- 
     MARLA SAM:  Because of -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- of -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- income -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- taxes.  
     MARLA SAM:  -- taxes. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So that's why the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Might could have -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- 2 percent.  I've never heard of merit being dismantled like this.  
     MARLA SAM:  (Indiscernible.)
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I've just never --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So I'm -- I'm curious about the way some things are working here, then, with this discussion.
     Are we -- are we giving step-in-grade off anniversary?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That was -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Are we giving merit off anniversary?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Why?   
     MARLA SAM:  It just happens that mine -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Merit -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- fell --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Merit's -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- the same. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- in conjunction -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  With the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  With --  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- evaluation. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- an evalu- -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  With the annual -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- annual --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- review.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- evaluation.
     MARLA SAM:  And I passed -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's correct. 
     MARLA SAM:  -- that.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  But some people -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aren't those done at the same time?  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  A step-in-grade?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Step-in-grade is done -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- at annual review?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No.  Well, -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Because they shouldn't -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- the step-in-grade -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- be getting a -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- could -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- step-in-grade unless they have -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  A step-in- -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- an eval.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- -grade could be given anytime.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Usually what happens, Mr. Commissioner, is that the director or supervisor anticipates that they want to give step-in-grades during the year.  And at the budget period, they put those in the budget.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  But wouldn't that be done through the annual evaluation process and say, now you've -- we're going to give you step-in-grades.  It's your evaluation.  We're going to step -- we're going to give you a step-in-grade annually at the -- at the reevaluation?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, if -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Which would be -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- you get -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the same time the merit would be done.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If they had put it in the budget.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right.  But what he's saying is you've got to do an eval to do either one.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Correct. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, I understand that.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And those are done annually.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If it's not in the budget, you're not going to get it.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- I do have a -- I do -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  So I'll give you an example.  This year, I gave both of my girls a step-in-grade at their evaluation.  And I put it in the budget.
     I did not give them the merit because I gave them the step-in-grade.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So you --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  But another one also -- Sadie Sullivan, for the record -- I've had to where I've had an employee, they got their 2 percent -- up to 2 percent, not the union, the step-in-grade.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, the -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Or not -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- merit.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- the step-in-grade.  The merit.  Thank you.
     And then if they pass -- because I -- I made out my job descriptions.  And I don't think most are like this.  I -- they have to be there for a certain amount of years.
     Plus they also have to go through so many elections.  Because that's such a huge thing in importance in my office.  
     So with that being said, that person could get their up to the 2 percent merit.  And they may not even hit it because maybe something happened and -- and they didn't make it through the election.  Or they make it through that two years of election.  
     Because my staff can't move unless they've done two years of election, which that could be a two-year period.  
     So I've gradually done mine so then that way people don't come on brand new at a rate that's 50 cents less than someone that's been here for 20 years.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  And I -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So then I -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- have the same ones. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  I feel that it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So I do -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- for the county's sake -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  You move from one to a two.  But to --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Nobody's identifying -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Before you can -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- themselves. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- go to a two, you have to be actually in that position -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  What's that? 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- first on which time.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Absolutely.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Sadie did.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  All right.  I do have --
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  At this time -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- a question.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Mine's time-sensitive.  And I think all offices need to be time- -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  But when you do your -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- -sensitive.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- step-in-grade, is that not done on the employee's anniversary at their evaluation?
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Not my step.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Why not?  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  My step-in-grade -- because they have to be there for an amount of years.  I can't -- they have to be there for an amount -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Or their -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- of years.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- amount of years.  Wouldn't that come on their -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- anniversary and then be done at the same -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And election.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- time their evaluation -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And election.
     So they have to hit those elections per my --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So... 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So they -- say -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  The -- the solution to this is that any raise given should be done at their anniversary when their evaluation is done, whether it's a step-in-grade or a merit.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So I do have another question if -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  No?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- I'm -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- able to.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  You can't -- you can't give a promotion.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Excuse me.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  It's a promotion.
     It's a promo- --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I do --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Go ahead.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Is there are positions within this county that do not have steps-in-grades, that in order to -- well.  Okay.  Let me take that back.  There are steps-in-grades but they require positions being open, certain licenses, and certifications.
     And it's also -- you know, I know we're not supposed to talk about it, but there are job descriptions that fall into the union contract that are set, that we cannot change their rates, that this is what the rate is, this is what they get.
     So we've created a discrepancy between certain employees not being able to get a raise during their evaluation, not being able to get that merit increase versus other positions that are.
     So where's the fairness here?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  The merit increase is at the discretion of the supervisor.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But yet you can't -- there are certain jobs that you cannot give them an increase.  They can't make more than the same person in their job classification.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  With a merit they can.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can with the merit.  They can't -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So Judie -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- with the --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So if -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- 	step-in-grade. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- you have a -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Judie, as an example, DMV (indiscernible) is DMV for four years.  Correct?  There was no -- you couldn't move up.  It was just flat out DMV clerk.  So there was nothing but your up to 2 percent merit and then whatever the union negotiated.  So she was --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- maxed.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  So you could always -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  So there wasn't -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- get your -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- those -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- 2 percent -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- step-in-grade -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- merit. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- levels for her to move up.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  What our about your Water and Sewer Tech 1?
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  They create- -- they created those, I think, about four years ago.  Before, they didn't have those step-in-grades for those Water and Sewers.  So they tried to -- at the same time that I did -- they tried to do those step-in-grades for water and sewer tech, maintainer, and do more of the step-in-grades so we were on a level that they had to either for years, certifications, that type of thing.  But it hasn't always been that way.  
     MARLA SAM:  Because now that we have the sync, which is my -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  State your name.  
     MARLA SAM:  -- I went up to the senior.  And we have a DMV clerk that I now trained that's now the DMV clerk.  And I got a promotion to be the senior and do the training and to be over that.  It was -- it was a promotion for me.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And it's just been recently --
     MARLA SAM:  It's just recently --
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- in the last year -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- that we hired someone.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- that it was created.  
     MARLA SAM:  She just came to work in, like, July or something like that.  You know.  So --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  So I want to go back to my question.  Okay.  We'll use the Maintainer 1.  In order to be a Maintainer 2, you have to have a CDL.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And some people will never have that.  So you can't give them a merit increase because --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, you -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Not a merit.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can --
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  You can --  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- give them -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- give them -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- a merit.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- a merit.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You can't give them a promotion.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  You can give a merit --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  You can't --
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- but not a step-in-grade.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  You can't give them -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Oh.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- a step-in- -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  That's -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- -grade.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- my question is --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can give them a merit always.  But you can't give them a -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But you can't -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- step --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Where -- our union -- doesn't the union contact -- contract state the amount?  The --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If it has -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- the scale? 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- nothing to do with merit.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And it's --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  They set a rate for -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It has -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- those --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- nothing to do -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's a cost -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- with the merit. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- to them. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Oh, my God. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  No. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  You guys -- you guys set the rates, Judie.
     The union doesn't set them.  All we -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  I -- it's a negotiated.  But when it says in the union contract:  Maintainer 1 will make $19 an hour.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And then they could make 2 percent -- up to 2 percent for a merit for the next five years.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And if they don't get their --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And that's what I'm -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- CDL, -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- asking.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And they -- yes, they can.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  That -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And they can get -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- was what -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- (indiscernible). 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  There's no --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- I was -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- question. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- asking. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     MARLA SAM:  If somebody leaves, they can move into that position, get their raise -- if they're -- yeah, that have all -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No question.  
     MARLA SAM:  -- of the qualifications. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  They need to state their names. 
     MARLA SAM:  If somebody leaves, they move into that position.  They get a promotion.  They get a -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Actually, I think -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- a step-in-grade and get a promotion -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the person doing -- 
     MARLA SAM:  -- and (indiscernible, too far from microphones). 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the transcript would recognize -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Marla Sam, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- their voice -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- for the record. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- now.  (Indiscernible.) 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Commissioner Mills, I would like to go back to your original question of anniversary dates.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  The step-in-grade -- or the step-in-grade is a promotion.  So that could be given -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Anytime.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- throughout the year.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Well, that -- that then -- 
     MARLA SAM:  It just happened that this one fell --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That just -- that then messes with the idea of separating -- or giving it either/or on merit or step-in-grade.
     Because if they're not done at the same time, then that really makes the argument very difficult.  
     Because if -- 
     MARLA SAM:  So if -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- you give -- if you give somebody a promotion, three months later is their anniversary, and now you're going to give them a merit increase.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Why -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  I think -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And that's what we're saying.  Are we going to -- is that -- that's --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's an -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- what we're saying. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- option.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's the question.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  (Indiscernible.)
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Do you want to give it -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And that's not -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- to them -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- necessar- -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the same year? 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's -- that's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- the bottom-line question. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's it. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Why not?  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  If the -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  My que- -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- if the promotion and the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- merit are always -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- we're not --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- done at -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- arguing -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the same -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  yes or no.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- time, --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You're going to have -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- then it's easy to -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- to decide. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- differentiate that question whether we're going to do it at the same -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- time or -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- not.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- this -- you know, payroll change requests always come before the commissioners.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Correct.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And -- and just like the past comment is, you know, you get -- you get a -- a step-in-grade, that is a promotion.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And in three months is their anniversary date.  
     So the question is, is are they allowed a -- a -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Merit.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- merit increase?  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Because they've already received a merit increase in a sense of -- of getting their step-in-grade.
     Their promotion is saying, you are doing a good job.  You deserve this position.  You deserve more money.
     And being as how it does come before the commission, if the agenda request is done properly and we can look back and it reflects that this -- this person did just receive a step-in-grade, then we can always deny it and say, I'm sorry, is -- you know, we understand that you are a valued employee, but you've already gotten your -- your increase.
     They don't necessarily happen, you know, on your anniversary date.  But they -- then again, like I mentioned, is you get your merit increase on your anniversary date.  If you get a step-in-grade afterwards, it's going to be more money anyway.  So that becomes another moot point.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.  And if -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So here's -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- if it's ever questioned by the commission, the supervisor gets up there and justifies it.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's what -- look, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So here's -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- I just want --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Here's the problem I'm having with this.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I think it's been kind of clear.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You get one or the other within the year.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So here's -- here's part of the problem with this.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  You give -- you give a promotion and a step-in-grade increase.  And within whatever period of time, it could be -- it could be the next week, the next month, the next six months.  Oh, now it's your anniversary.  Here's your -- here's another 2 percent.  We're saying, well, that's not necessarily the way we want this to work.
     If the -- if the -- if the promotion and the merit were on the same date, it's a clear answer.  We don't want you to get both -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- at that time.
     You start separating that with time, and we're going to say, oh, you got your step-in-grade increase a while ago.  And now we're looking at your anniversary date.  We're going to give you a 2 percent increase.  
     So what time frame are we looking at?
     We -- we want to do that or we don't want to do that within what frame of time?
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Do we need to then state that if you get a -- if you get a step-in-grade increase, that becomes your new anniversary date?
     Then you have your step-in-grade that's good for a year.  A year from that date you get your 2 -- you start your 2 percent merit increase possibilities.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That -- that -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That would be the only way to resolve this.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That -- that's what I said.  A year.  You need -- that's where the year comes in.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So because you're always going to run into one employee got their step-in-grade increase and every -- since everybody's going to be different for their anniversary date after that, one employee might have their anniversary date three months after that.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Uh-huh. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  The other might be six months.  The other might be nine months.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And the employee that has the anniversary date three months after and we're saying, oh, that's too close. You can't have a merit increase within three months of your step-in-grade increase.
     Then they're going to complain and say, well, I had to wait -- I had to wait extra period of time to become eligible again for my merit increase.  Whereas the person -- if it's -- if their anniversary is six months after their step-in-grade increase.  And we're going to say, oh, that's okay if it's six months.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So we're putting -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- a date. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- this -- you get this time frame differentiation for every employee.  Because the time of their step-in-grade increase and the time of their anniversary is different for everyone because those don't occur at the same time frame.
     So one of two things needs to happen.
     We either do step-in-grade increases and merit increases and -- and that eligibility for those only comes on anniversary dates.  Or if we give a step-in-grade increase, that becomes the new anniversary date for that employee.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's the only way to resolve it.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  And Commissioner, that's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Because -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- how our -- that's how our office did it.  We got two steps-in-grades.  And they're not eligible for a merit for a year from that point. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  From that step-in- -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- -grade increase.  That's the only -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- way to resolve it.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Well, because I did it on their anniversary date.  And my question to Keith is, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- is when you're giving step-in-grade promotions, are you not supplying the evaluations when you do that?
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Liz, you need to -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Are you sure?  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- identify yourself.
     Elizabeth Barela. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  It -- it -- it -- it -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So -- so Sadie's over here and she has an employee that's hired on whatever date.  And they have to be there through two election cycles before they can get a merit incre- -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- or step- -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- two years -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- -in-grade.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- anniversary date.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  No.  I've done it before.  Because they've -- they've -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- completed --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- they -- would they go through an election?
     They go through the next election.  Immediately after that election, regardless of the anniversary date, it sounds like you're doing.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That's not two years, though.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  You're doing your -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  I've gone two elections -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- step-in-grade.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- not two elections meaning -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Two years.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  I've done primary as an election and the general as an election.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So immediately after that second election you're going -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Not immediately. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- you're going step-in-grade.  Are you waiting -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  It's on the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- for the -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- performance too. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Are you waiting for their anniversary? 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Nope.  I don't wait for the anniversary.  If they have -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  See.  So -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's the problem.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  There you go.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  That's not a problem.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's the problem.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Because it's happened -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So we either need -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- in the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- to get -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- past.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- dictate that.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  That's not a problem.  That's what's worked for my office.  And I -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  For this to work -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- have gave a merit increase up to -- say mine -- from what I understand and what's been done on our merits, they've been in July.
     I wish there was other people here.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Your merits or your anniversary date?  Not July.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  If -- if we went back and we were to pull everything, I guarantee you there's been a lot of people that have gotten their merit increases July 1.  Because it's been stated -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Because that's -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- through the HR -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the new fiscal year.  And there -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- in the past -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the money's available.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  You'd have go back, like, 12-plus years -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  No. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- because we haven't had merits in that long. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Okay.  Well, my point is, is they have went ahead and they gave them in July for their up to and done the evaluations.  And they've submitted them to HR.  Because HR would say that you have to have those evaluations turned in annually to even be able to get that.
     UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT:  True.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And that's what has happened.  So I've given a per- -- I gave a person up to a 2 percent merit increase July, August -- usually it's August because I'm busy in July.
     And then they get that 2 percent.  They won't get a step-in-grade until they've hit both those elections.  It could be after June 1st of the primary.  And so, yeah, they've had, like, you know, 25 cents or 15 or whatever the heck the percentage is.  And they will get that merit, that 2 percent for that many months.  And then they can -- as long as I budgeted for it in that budget year -- they do get their step-in-grade.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And that's where -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  But I see where Doug's saying -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's where we need to correct that.  So it's got to -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  But yours -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- it's got to -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- is the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- be the one of two -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- opposite, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- things. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- Doug.  Yours is opposite.  You're saying to -- you're saying step-in-grade and then a merit.  Mine is a merit and then a step-in-grade.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, it doesn't matter which way -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Yeah. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- it goes.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Well -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  It does.  Because -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No. 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  Because what happens is mine isn't getting that step-in-grade.  And they may not get it because they may not be there.
     So I don't feel like what I've done in the past -- for a merit up to the 2 percent, that's not wrong.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'm not saying you're right or wrong.  I'm saying that that's not the issue.  The issue is, do -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- you get them both in that same year?  That's the issue.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Or the same month, like he's saying.  Because the year is kind of -- I don't agree with the year.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, that's what they're discussing, whether you agree with it or I agree with it.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Right. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's what -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- they're discussing.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  The motion is --
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  We need to make it clear.  Because I -- say I gave them a merit increase in August and then after the primary's done in June, I go ahead and I will give them a step-in-grade.  They can't get their 2 percent in July again because I've already gave them their step-in-grade.  But it's in -- within that calendar budget -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, I -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- year.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We understand, Sadie.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Okay.  Just making sure.  Because some people -- Art's been an employee of the county and appreciates this as -- sorry, Art.  Just using you as an example.  But to have those increases.  And Marla and whomever else is here.  To get those raises as employees or step-in-grades, it's important to keep your valuable people on.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We understand your position.  I'm just telling you that what they're trying to decide.  I'm not taking a position on this.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  No.  No.  I know.  But I'm just letting them know from experience of what we've done to where there's a lot that haven't been on the board to know what's been done in the past.  Art's gone through it through the school board.  So he has an understanding, in my opinion.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, I -- I've been through a lot of different contracts, classified, and certificated.  And I've never heard of merit being done like this.
     My impression, my understanding of merit, the way it has been discussed up until today, was that every employee had a chance to earn up to 4 percent per year.
     That was my understanding.  And now, no.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  It -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  They had the -- up to 2 percent per year here.
     That's -- you -- that should be your understanding because that's what they can do, depends on the -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  But he's saying 4 percent total?  Is that correct, Art? 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Be -- because he's -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yes. 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- adding the -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  He's adding -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  If they don't get a -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  He's adding -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- promotion.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the union.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  If they don't get a promotion -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- each employee's up to 4 percent, which is how it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  No. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- set.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  The merit should be up to the supervisor.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It is.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It is.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  And if they say, okay, I'm evaluating you today and you did a good job, I'm giving you a 2 percent.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  That's how -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- it is.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Now, if it just happens to coincide the same day as an evaluation and a promotion, what's wrong with that?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's the question.
     You -- you -- you don't say what's wrong with it and what's right with it, because there's two opposing sides.  There's five of you have to make that decision.  That's it.  It's that simple.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Just make the decision.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I mean, if you -- whether you can do --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  We have a motion, -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- today or -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- just no vote.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- three months from -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If it -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- now, it's the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Art.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- same thing.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  It's how you interpret -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Art.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- the motion.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It's -- it's the same -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Huh? 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- argument -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  It's how you interpret the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- that everybody's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- motion.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- making.  Just make the decision.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  It doesn't really clarify it.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Well, when -- okay.  So eight months ago, Liz, you brought this to my attention and we put the merit back on.  
     And in those discussions, when we put it on here to approve it, it was in that twelve-month period or year, they either got a merit or they got a promotion and a raise.  That was what was discussed when we brought back the merit.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Was that in a meeting?
     Sadie Sullivan, -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  No, we -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- for the record. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- well, I thought it was.  Because we did it in a meeting too.  But now it's back on -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- here for clarification.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That was -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- what was -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- from that -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- discussed -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- April 27th --
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- in the agenda -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- meeting.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- setting.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yes.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  And that's how it was supposed to be discussed at the meeting.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  But at the meeting, there was no talk about the promotion part of it.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Got you.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  It just was --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Because -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- step-in-grade. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- it wasn't agendized right.  So now it's agendized right to clarify why we brought back the merit.  Or we can make it simple, just not do the merit.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, the merit -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Then we won't even have that discussion anymore.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You've already decided the merit.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I know.  But it's what I'm saying.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So what -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, you can't undo the merit in this agenda setting.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Let me put it -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You're -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- this way.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- missing the point, Ted.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'm trying to -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  When Liz brought this to my attention eight months ago, if I knew it was going to be this big of a deal -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I am trying -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- today, I would have been like, -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- to keep us -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- no?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'm trying to keep us on -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And I do value the employees.  And that's why we're doing it.  But -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  Let me -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  It -- it's not a big deal, Sean.  I just want to know if we can do them on the same day, that's great.  I'm all for it.  If -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, it -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- you guys want -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- makes it easier.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- it -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  If it's in your -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- three months -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- budget, -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- apart -- 
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  -- why not? 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- or six months or change their anniversary dates, I'm good with whatever you want to do.  Same day's fine with me.  Or I'm -- I support that.  I just want to know how --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Unless -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- it works.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We're asking the same questions.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We want every -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I know.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- good employee to -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  They -- they just got to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- have a raise -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- make the decision.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- once a year.  Period.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Whether they get it through the step- -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Merit. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- -in-grade or they get it through the merit, we want to be sure that they're compensated financially.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That was -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the idea.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- exactly the point.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's the point.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  But it gets complicated because of timing issues between when a step-in-grade is given and when a merit is given.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, and that -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So that complicates the -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But it -- but it -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- issue.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- shouldn't, because a step-in-grade moves your new anniversary day.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Exactly. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  And that's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- if you have a -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- and that's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- step-in-grade in July and your anniversary was in September, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- it is now -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- do you want to add -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- July.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- that to your motion?  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Right. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  The -- a step- --  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- -in-grade --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  No.  Okay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- becomes your new anniversary date.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well, what -- I will make the motion that -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We have a motion on the -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You got to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- floor.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- amend it.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I will amend the motion that a merit increase of up to 2 percent on the anniversary date, you cannot get a step-in-grade at the same time.  We will allow a step-in-grade during the year.  But in order for a merit increase, they would have to have a year from that anniversary date of the step-in-grade.  
     So basically is -- okay, you can get your -- your merit increase.  Six months later you get a step-in-grade.
     Okay.  You're not going to get another merit increase until -- or -- or merit increase until that anniversary date of that step-in-grade.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right.  Because when you get your -- your step-in-grade, you're getting a raise.  So that's putting you above your merit increase anyway.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  By far.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So you can't have another one for another year.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  But you can't anyway.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  The motion is really -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can't -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yeah. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Anyway.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Yeah, it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It's a little.  Yeah.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can't -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  It's confusing.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- anyway right now. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  What?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You can't now.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Can't what now?
     What?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Hey, Liz, don't go anywhere.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If you get a -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You helped me design this.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- step-in-grade, the change of your anniversary year and you're not eligible for another one for a year.  Right now.  That's how it is.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You're making motion that says, how we presently have the system.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  You get either a merit increase on your anniversary date.  You're entitled to a merit increase on your anniversary date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  If you receive a step-in-grade, you will not be eligible for a merit increase until the anniversary date of that step- -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Just say -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- -in-grade.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- it triggers a new anniversary date.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  But that's how it -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  No.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- is right now.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Then what's the question?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  The question is:  Are you eligible for a -- are you eligible for a promotion that -- the same basic year as a merit increase?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yes.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's it.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Then, yes, you're eligible for a promotion.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Then -- then vote that -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  All we wanted -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- way.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Vote that way and -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, then --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Then vote it.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- we're good.  We're good. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I mean, I don't care. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  The motion on the floor doesn't say that, though.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No, it doesn't.   
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  All right.  I will amend my amended motion to basically state that, yes, you are eligible for promotion af- -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Within the same year --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- within the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- as the merit. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- same year as your merit increase. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Perfect.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah, but are you -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Perfect.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But not on the same anniversary date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  But not on the same anniversary.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But not on the same anniversary -- 
     MARLA SAM:  So you -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- date.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  There you go.
     MARLA SAM:  So you get your merit increase in three weeks and it works.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Marla, you need to identify yourself for our -- 
     MARLA SAM:  Marla Sam.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- record.  It's -- thank you.
     MARLA SAM:  Everybody knows me.  I've been -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  That isn't -- no, we record this.  And every time -- 
     MARLA SAM:  I know. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- it's recorded, we have "Unidentified participant.  Unidentified participant."
     MARLA SAM:  I'm unidentified.  No.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.  We know who you are.  
     MARLA SAM:  I just -- I just don't understand how -- how come it's (indiscernible).  It just happened to be --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'm going to withdraw my second, though, because it's not -- 
     MARLA SAM:  So soon.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- how it was designed.
     MARLA SAM:  So soon.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So let me get this right.  You can still earn up to 4 percent per year.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Two percent.
     We're excluding the 2 percent contract cost-of-living increase.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  You can still -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Art, you're asking me questions that we're not supposed to be -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- discussing. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.  We can't -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Two percent -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- talk about the union.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  The 2 percent is in there.  The merit increase is in there.  
     The only question to answer is:  Can you get the merit and the promotion within the same year?
     That's it.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I don't understand why -- okay.  This isn't that -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Why not? 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- hard.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It's not -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  The -- the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- that hard.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- your department head's either going to know if they're going to get a promotion or if they're either going to get a merit increase within that year.  It's not that hard.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  It's not.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  And you have to budget for it.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  They either get one or the other within that year.  Yes.  It's got to be budgeted.  
     So if the promotion's not budgeted in there, then the merit increase will be budgeted in there.  And they can either get that or not.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  But if -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  It's not that hard.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  If it -- no, it's not.  If it's budgeted in the same year, like Marla says, can -- can -- if you vote to let them do it in the same year, then, yes, three weeks later they can do it.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  No.  They get one or the other in same year.  It's going to be budgeted that way. 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's not the motion.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  That's not the motion.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That's not -- 
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  That's why he -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the motion.  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  -- withdrew his second.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That's why I withdraw my second.  Because that's not how it was -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- designed eight months ago when we did this.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well, maybe we're revamping the design --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Well, -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- since we have more -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- maybe we are.  Maybe we aren't.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- discussion regarding it.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  Let's -- let's have Sean try the motion.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Well -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Keith -- Keith had a comment.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No, I just -- all I was going to -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  She's got to withdraw her motion.  Or it dies.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I think -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It died. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- it was put pretty clear by the motion from Judie that it can be done at the same time.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Not at the same --
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- time.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  In the same -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  In the same -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- year.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  -- period.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Same year. 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  I'm sorry.  In the same period.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Same year.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Same year.  Period.
     That's the ques- -- that's the -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Right, she made -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Hey -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- the motion.  It hasn't been --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Okay.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- seconded.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So does anyone want to second that or not?  
     Does it die or not, Chair?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I -- yeah.  Well --
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I don't think they remember what the motion was.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I can tell you what the motion was.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I know what the motion was.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But -- but they don't -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- want it the same year.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I will make a motion that we approve they either get a merit increase or step-in-grade increase within the fiscal year, one or the other, but not both, within that fiscal year.
     It can't get much simpler than that.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  They will just have to change if they have a step-in-grade.  It will have to wait.  That's all -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- there is to it.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  But -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So I'll second your motion.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Your -- your department heads should know one way or the other.  And if they don't, then they probably ought not be the darned department head.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Don't go there.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  I'll be back to change my job descriptions.  Sadie Sullivan, for the record.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  That's fine too.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So -- you know, I -- I'm -- I'm not arguing anything.  I'm just going to throw another -- another option, hypothetical, out there.  Is -- you got a department and you're a Clerk 1 and let's say your Clerk 2 leaves for whatever reason and that position's open.  But your Clerk 1 just got her merit increase.  So she can't move up to Clerk 2 because she can't.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  That's right.  But she's probably still going to do the job, which we get before us all the time. We've been doing the job for a year.  We'd like to now move her up.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Yeah.  So that -- that in itself right there is not going to work.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It's an exception.  Absolutely.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  It is the not necessary -- they're all exceptions.  We have had -- we've gotten so many exceptions thrown at us.  Is --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     Is that clear, though, what I just said?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And we'll handle it as an exception when it comes up, Judie.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yes.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  One or the other in a year.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And exceptions don't have happen very often.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Fiscal year.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I think exceptions happen a lot.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  So are you going to amend your motion to -- to take extreme exceptions before the board?  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll amend the motion to take extreme exceptions before the board.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  All right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll amend my second.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You got it.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  You got the motion.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Sean made a motion.  Patsy seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  So is this acceptable to you, Sean?  And -- and Liz?  And Ted?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Uh-huh.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Well, it seems -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Liz, isn't that -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- to be. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- how it's supposed to work?  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  What?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  The merit?  
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  I -- I didn't hear what she said.  What? 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Is it acceptable?  The motion?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yes, it is.
     ELIZABETH BARELA:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I'll answer for her.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Vote.  Let's vote, please.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Nay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yikes.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Four ayes and one nay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Agenda Item Number 13.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  I thought that was going to be the easy one of the day.  Right?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  But not.  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  An hour.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Employees.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Almost.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  That's (indiscernible).
     
13)	Discussion for possible action regarding the yearly performance evaluation of Keith Westengard, Lander County executive director.  The commission will decide when they want to give said evaluation and to give the Lander County district attorney direction to send legal notice to the executive director pursuant to NRS 241.031.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So Item 13.  Discussion for possible action regarding the yearly performance evaluation of Keith Westengard, Lander County executive director.  The commission will decide when they want to give said evaluation and to give the Lander County district attorney direction to send legal notice to the executive director pursuant to -- pursuant to NRS 241.031.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Now, I'd like to point out that the reason it says, give the Lander County district attorney direction.  Usually I help the HR in preparing these notices.  And the only HR we have now is -- is Keith.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Keith.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Keith's office.  So there's a conflict of interest in sending the notice.
     So Keith and -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Do we have to -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- I talked -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- make an exception?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- and I said I'd take the notice.  But you would have to give me direction to do it and -- and the time to make proper notice.  It's -- that's --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Another exception.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Yeah.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  When is your anniversary date, Keith?  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Monday.  It was 11. September 11th.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Really?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Uh-huh.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  How many years ago?
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Three.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Cool.  Okay.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Is that as -- Sadie Sullivan, for the record -- is that as the executive director?  Or when you came on?  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  No, that's as executive director.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Was that -- 
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  My anniversary date with the county is October 1st.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  So you can get a merit increase?
     Sorry.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But when we gave him the step-in-grade up, he changed anniversary dates.
     Well, the next -- our next meeting is the 12th.  If that gives everybody time?
     Or if we were delaying it, it would be the 26th of October.  So whatever -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  The -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  The -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- 12th -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- 12th -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- works.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- is fine.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Ted, does that give the DA's Office time?  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  We need five days to give him notice.  And you -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  (Indiscernible.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That should give him plenty of time.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  So the 12th of -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I make a motion that we direct the Lander County district attorney to do some legal notice to our executive director that we will be holding evaluations on October 12th at the commission meeting.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Second.
     Patsy made a motion.  Sean seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  (Indiscernible.)
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Oh.  Hey, Art needs a break.
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  (Indiscernible.) 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I can't.  I don't -- what is that?
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  I think the volume's too loud.  Or are they still on?  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Austin, are you there?  
     MITESHELL LANHAM:  We're here.  
     COUNTY CLERK SULLIVAN:  Maybe see if we can turn it (indiscernible).
     MITESHELL LANHAM:  Hello? 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Yep.  Sorry, Miteshell.  We got -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- static and -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Let's -- let's take a break for a minute.  See if we can figure out what this problem is.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Sadie needs to figure out the phones.  I'm sorry.
     
     (Break taken between 11:10 a.m. and 11:21 a.m.)

14)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the professional engineering services proposal from Day Engineering in an amount not to exceed $266,000 and go out for bi d on water line installation located at 22nd Street to Allen Road, Battle Mountain, and all other matters properly related thereto. 
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I believe we are on Item Number 14.
     Discussion for -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  No.  Did -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Pardon me?
     Are we on 14?  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Yes.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All right.
     Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove the professional engineering service from Day Engineering in an amount not to exceed $266,000 and go out to bid on water line installation located at 22nd Street to Allen Road, Battle Mountain, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     Take it easy -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  Okay. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- on us, Bert.  
     BERT RAMOS:  We're back.  So here -- yeah, there's some -- there is some consideration to be done on this.
     I want to give this to the board and let you guys make the call.
     So with the -- with some of our other projects that we're going to have coming up here in the near future, most developers are paying, you know, there's a -- there's some sort of a cost share on the installation of water line.  This, we would like to pave this road obviously this year so we have their truck bypass.  And we want to get the water line in beforehand.  So we'd recoup our revenue through connection fees and through the road being built to a pavable standard by the developer before we went in and paved it.
     And them are the -- them are the considerations that are kind of in front of you guys, whether you guys want to go forward with this water line or if you guys think that the developer should be paying more for their part for us to move forward with this water line, in short.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But right now this is just the -- the engineering cost.
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes, this is the engineering -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  -- cost to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- they would still be paying for the water line.  But developers pay for an engineering cost?  That's all part of it (indiscernible)?
     BERT RAMOS:  This is -- this is part of the engineering to put this project out to bid.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Right.  But I'm saying -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  And -- and to complete the project.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  When developers come in they usually pay for some of the engineering costs too.  Is that it?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Well, they would pay for -- they could potentially pay for a percentage of that.  But usually -- so if the developer was going to develop and they were only going to put a -- in -- in their -- in their subdivision, say, an 8-inch water main would -- would be sufficient for whatever they're -- for their apartment complex.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And we want to put a 12?  
     BERT RAMOS:  And we're going to put a 16 in.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Oh. 
     BERT RAMOS:  Well, they would only cost-share us for the 8-inch.  Anything above and beyond that, we would -- we would have to -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  That -- that, -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  Carry that -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- I knew. 
     BERT RAMOS:  -- burden.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But I didn't know if -- I -- I -- if -- if we went back and -- and charged them for part of the engineering costs, I didn't know they paid a cost share on that.  
     BERT RAMOS:  No, no, no, no.  See if -- so is where this engineering is, is if -- if we go out with this job, then -- then we are accepting the fact that the county is paying for this water line.  That's why I'm bringing that point up.  Because otherwise --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Isn't the developer paying for the road, though?  
     BERT RAMOS:  The developer.  And giving the easement, by the way.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But we can still cost-share with the developer on the road.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  We don't have to, though.  He's paying for the whole thing.
     BERT RAMOS:  No, not --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  But -- but when they came -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  They bring it up to an Orange Book standard. And then we take over and -- and pave it.  Once we -- once we do an inspection on the road, then we go do compaction tests to make sure it's the proper width, the proper amount of base, and then -- then they turn it over to us, and -- and we go forward and pave it.  But we don't pay for the -- for the road.  No.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Do we have enough water for this?
     BERT RAMOS:  We do have enough water.  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  For how many more connections do we have enough water?
     BERT RAMOS:  We -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's a big concern.
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes.  We can -- we can roughly double.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  We can double the amount of connections --
     BERT RAMOS:  Roughly, with -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- that we have presently?
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes.  With the -- with what's coming off of -- what we've taken off the system currently.
     And --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Taken off the system with the purple pipe project?
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes.  So --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And you have this in your budget too?
     BERT RAMOS:  I do have this in the budget.  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll make a motion to approve the professional engineering service proposal from Day Engineering in an amount not to exceed 266,000 and to go out to bid on a water line installation located at 22nd Street to Allen Road.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Is that -- is that completing what you're asking?
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You're asking if we want to do a cost share with the developer on this or not. 
     BERT RAMOS:  Well, no.  I'm -- I'm asking if you guys want us to go out to bid on this project.  So we put the water line in before we pave the road.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Oh, you don't want to put the road in and then -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  No.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- tear it up and put the water line in.
     BERT RAMOS:  Exactly.  But I just wanted to make that clear before we -- before you proceeded.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll second the motion.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  If we -- if put this in, can we back charge the owner developer?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  We'll get -- we'll get -- every time they connect to our water main, we'll get a percentage of it back.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I mean, on the -- on running the line?
     See, this is -- this is the discussion about the subdivision and responsibilities thereof.  And, you know, one person builds a subdivision.  The other person skirts around the subdivision rules.
     So I -- I think that, you know, it's going out there.  We know where it's going.  I think that the builder-developer needs to pay some too.
     BERT RAMOS:  Well, and I guess the exception here is, is that we are getting the -- the easement and the road brought up to a pavable standard.  And we're also making our truck bypass so we have from overpass to overpass, which has been discussed, -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Oh, okay.
     BERT RAMOS:  -- you know, since -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  There was kind of like a cost sharing going on there.
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  If -- if that was the -- if there was a reason to have an exception for this, I think that'd be it.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.  You're good with that?
     BERT RAMOS:  Oh, yeah.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Sean made a motion -- motion.  Patsy seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?  
     (No comment.) 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.

     BERT RAMOS:  Okay.  I brought Ken Mallory with me here so he can give you guys a clearer, better explanation than I can.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  He's been waiting all morning for this?  
     BERT RAMOS:  He knows all about -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  (Indiscernible.) 
     BERT RAMOS:  -- 2 percent.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And you're from Reno, Ken?  
     KEN MALLORY:  Yes.
     BERT RAMOS:  So Ken is our certified operator for our wastewater.
     KEN MALLORY:  Okay.  So the bottom line on this, what happened --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Ken, state your name, please.
     KEN MALLORY:  Pardon me?  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  State your name, please.
     KEN MALLORY:  Ken Mallory.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Thank you.  
     KEN MALLORY:  The bottom line is the state's changing the permit on the phosphorous and the -- the ditch.  And we're on a federal permit that goes to the -- the river.
     They are proposing a limit of 0.33, which is really low.  And the existing is 2.0.  So it's more than six times lower than what we're doing.
     The cost of treating phosphorous is ex- -- expensive.  The options are either adding a mechanical plant to another addition to the sewer treatment plant with possibly chemical addition there.  We're experimenting now with adding alum to the -- to the system to treat for phosphorous.  But getting that down to that low is tough.
     Churchill County, which is a facility we run, is costing about $2 a customer per month for chemical.  So it's quite an expense.
     The other option that was brought up before with a previous -- I think it was Jake.  Anyways, he -- we were talking about wetlands, and the concern was mosquitoes.
     Not to go to -- see, if you go to wetlands, you can go to just a state permit.  And a state permit is a lot more lenient than the federal permit.
     So what we need is direction of what you -- you guys think.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So what would a wetlands incorporate with our facility we have today?
     KEN MALLORY:  What would it do?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  What would it change?
     KEN MALLORY:  It's just a disposal site.  Because right now we're going out the back and going out to a ditch that runs to the river.  And wetlands, what it'd do is it'd contain it all on Lander County land with no access for it to go into the air.  So it'd either evaporate or go back into the groundwater.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So we -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Does that mean we'd have -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- would just -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Oh, go ahead.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'm sorry.  We just -- we just close up the -- the creek that's running it out?  Is that what we -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  No, you just redirect it.  And, see, before, when we had ponds here, that's what we had.
     There was wetlands and RIBs in the back.  RIBs are rapid infiltration basins, which allows the water to soak back into the -- into the ground faster and have a expanse that it evaporates quick.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  How about the odor or anything?  
     KEN MALLORY:  There's very little.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  It's all -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Very little.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- treated before it goes.  
     KEN MALLORY:  One -- one thing that you have too is you've got, you know, a lot of plant life and stuff that grows there and it uptakes nitrogen in -- in your wetlands.  So it's a plus that way also.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So it's a win-win?
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We have --
     KEN MALLORY:  It's just a matter if -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- you have enough -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- have less -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- it's just a matter if you have enough land.  It needs to be -- have a study done.  But it needs -- you've got to have enough land for buildout on that plant.  So that plant's a 800,000-gallon-a-day plant.  So the amount of area has to be equivalent that it can accept that much water.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  And we own all that much?  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  I think we have -- we just got 900 acres out there.  We should be good.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  We have enough land -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- for that.  
     KEN MALLORY:  So, I mean, that's just one of the -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- concerns that I -- you know. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That's what I was going to -- don't -- don't we already have ponds out at the facility out there? 
     BERT RAMOS:  Lime ponds.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Lime ponds.  
     KEN MALLORY:  The lime ponds are for sludge disposal.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  So we don't put this in the lime pond?  
     KEN MALLORY:  No.  No.  This is you want this water to go out and soak back into the groundwater and evaporate.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So you just openly out into the -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- open land?  Okay.  So do -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  (Indiscernible.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- you -- do you put berms?  Do you have to create -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah, you've -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- a -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- got to -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- containment -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- create -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- area?  
     KEN MALLORY:  It's got to be a -- a designed area that they -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay. 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- can contain all that water.
     And, you know, right now we're around 300,000 gallons a day.  So it's going to have to be more than twice that size to take the 800 if it ever got that far.  And during the -- the rain events this last year, we -- we were quite higher than 300.  We were up to 500,000, it said.  So it's got to be able to accept all that.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So in order to change permits, we have to do a study?  
     KEN MALLORY:  Well, you need to see if it's -- it's feasible to -- to begin with.
     And then from there then we take steps.  I had gone with -- talked to NDEP last time, talked to fish and game.  Fish and game was interested in it.  They were going to provide some small fish that -- that ate mosquito larvae.  And then BLM was going to provide some trees and shrubs and stuff too.  That was sort of in the works before.  And then it was -- what I was told, it was run before the commissioners.  And it was put a stop to.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So this is -- so we're going to actually create something with permanent standing water?
     KEN MALLORY:  Well, yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Is that --
     KEN MALLORY:  It's --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  We're going to build big old pond out there.  
     KEN MALLORY:  Right.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  So it's not going to infiltrate that rapidly, that you dump it out there, it just sinks in the ground.  It's actually going to be standing water basically year round?
     KEN MALLORY:  It -- it infiltrates into, I mean.  But you're always providing that much more water every day --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Every day. 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- out there.  So it keeps it fresh.  And there's quite a few of these around Nevada.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     KEN MALLORY:  So --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So there's nothing that -- that we would be -- that this pond has in it that would be adverse to wildlife of any -- of any type?  
     KEN MALLORY:  No.  No.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Nothing hurts.  
     KEN MALLORY:  City of Fernley has the Fernley wildlife area they discharge into.  And their quality of their water that's going out there is --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Pretty good?  
     KEN MALLORY:  -- not near anything that we put out here.  Because they have ponds there.  And ponds don't provide real good treatment.  It does some, but it's not excellent.
     The quality of the water here is much better than what -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So the -- the cost of the study, is that something you have in your budget that you have enough flexibility?
     BERT RAMOS:  Well, it's -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Do you have any idea what we're talking?
     BERT RAMOS:  We do have -- well, when we augment the budget from money that's supposed to be rolled over, we have money.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  
     KEN MALLORY:  We need to look -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  (Indiscernible) -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- at that.  
     BERT RAMOS:  -- first, if that makes sense.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.  No, it sounds like it's a win-win.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Ken, so when you're talking 800,000 gallons, can you give me an idea of, like, how many acres that would be?
     KEN MALLORY:  They get -- there's got to be tests on the soil and everything else to see the -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- infiltration rates.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  I guess I was just curious of sizewise, you know, trying to get a -- a picture of how much water that is in an area is, is actually even a possibility of aerating it.
     You know.  They did the solar aeration down in Kingston for the -- the pond down there is, you know.  
     Just out of curiosity sake -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Right. 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- if it would -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah, I mean, -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- kind of help.  
     KEN MALLORY:  -- the whole idea of this is simple.  You put it out there.  It goes back into the groundwater.  It replenishes the groundwater and evaporates into the -- 
     You know, it's -- it's cost-efficient.  And you just maintain the ponds.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Does this also need to be fenced off or --
     KEN MALLORY:  It -- probably with barbed wire.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  
     KEN MALLORY:  We have -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Not -- not real extensive --
     KEN MALLORY:  No.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- fencing, though. 
     KEN MALLORY:  Cold Springs has RIBs back behind at Washoe County's facility.  And they have eight ponds that are RIBs and they're at about 400 thou in a day now.  And there's not an issue with it.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     KEN MALLORY:  And those are ponds.  The -- plus going from ponds to our -- to wetlands, wetlands are -- are -- have cattails and other growth in them that will uptake a lot of the nitrogen.  So it prevents that nitrogen from going into the groundwater.  Even though we have limits on our -- on the treatment plant, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Uh-huh. 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- the limit is 10.  And actually the -- right now that our limit's lower than that.  
     So when you're putting that in RIBs, it's basically just going into the ground.  There's no additional treatment.  But if you put it into a wetlands, you have additional treatment from the plant life that's in it.  And it takes up phosphorous and nitrogen and plus any other BOD, you know, the basic food that's left in there.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'll make a motion that we go ahead with the study for the modification of the sewer plant water permit to a wetlands permit.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Second.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  Patsy made a motion.  Sean seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     MARTY UGALDE:  Thank you.  Marty Ugalde with Day Engineering.  
     Just wanted to add to what Ken was saying.  
     I was involved with the City of Fernley when we did the change.  They went out to RIBs.  We did the change and the treatment to go out to the wildlife management area.  
     And just adding to what Ken had mentioned, for that permit, it requires an environmental study.  Because as Ken mentioned, you have to talk to fish and wildlife, division of -- of -- I mean,  fish and game, division of wildlife, BLM, all of the -- all of the public a- -- agencies and entities that you can imagine.
     And also the other part that -- that you had asked about as far as the volume of storage, the one thing that you have to consider when you're talking about storage is wintertime storage.  Because you don't get the evaporation or the infiltration that you would in the summertime.  But you do have plants that uptake water and -- and the nutrients.  So just to kind of add to that.  That study, it requires an environmental -- environmental assessment and -- and all that.  So there's quite a bit to those studies.  Just to --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So that -- 
     MARTY UGALDE:  -- give you -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- just made it into a long-term project.
     MARTY UGALDE:  Yeah.  Permitting does take a while because for the entities to respond usually takes a -- a considerable amount of time.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  When -- when does this new standard of point -- what did you say?  It was point 2 -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  0.33.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  0.33?  When does that standard need to be met?  
     KEN MALLORY:  With the new permit.  But they -- they're -- they're -- if they know you're in the midst of trying to do something else, then there's a (indiscernible) -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  So that -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- (indiscernible) -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- allows us more time.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So when's -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the new permit?  
     KEN MALLORY:  I'm not sure the exact date on it.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Within the year?  
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  You can renew those permits once a year for the sewer?  
     KEN MALLORY:  No, it's -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  Every five, -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Five --
     BERT RAMOS:  -- I believe.
     KEN MALLORY:  -- years.
     MARTY UGALDE:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Oh.  And it's up this year?
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  
     KEN MALLORY:  And we're trying to add -- they're doing this all over the state, changing the phosphorous numbers.  So...
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Well, I think this is a -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So we're not -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- positive.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- we're not the only ones going through this process.  
     KEN MALLORY:  No.  No.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  
     KEN MALLORY:  It's -- like I say, -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All right. 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- Churchill County, they got them a year and a half, two years ago.  Seems --
     BERT RAMOS:  Another thing, -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- to me.  
     BERT RAMOS:  -- I think that Division of Water Resources actually gives you some sort of credit for how much you put back.  There's -- there's something to that, isn't there?  
     MARTY UGALDE:  Well, with the water rights like, for example, the City of Reno, they're treated (indiscernible) plant to the river.  And what the City of Reno gets with the Division of Water Resource for water rights -- because obviously water rights is a big deal there with new houses, new homes, they get a return flow credit.  Because they're taking the water that they're -- in other words, they're providing water to the consumer.  The consumer's flushing part of it down the toilet.  But that part that they're flushing actually makes it back to the river on the downstream side.  
     So the Division of Water Resource says that you're -- even though you're using 1.02 acre-feet or whatever it is, you're returning part of that.  So now you are -- you can allow each individual lot that's getting water for water -- from a water right perspective -- they only need -- instead of 1.02, they might need 0.62 acre-feet.  So that lets you spread out the water rights, more houses.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  But we're already returning it.  
     MARTY UGALDE:  And you're returning it right now.  Yeah.  So I'm not sure water rights for the -- for -- well, you do have an issue with the Well 9, I guess.
     BERT RAMOS:  Separate basins.
     KEN MALLORY:  And one -- the other item, when this started before, it was an NDEP suggestion that possibly go to --
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  To go to -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  -- wetlands.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- wetland.
     KEN MALLORY:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay.  Thank you.   
     KEN MALLORY:  Thank you.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Thank you, Ken.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Oh.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Safe -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- travels.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Thank you.
     Very -- 
     KEN MALLORY:  Have a nice -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- interesting.
     KEN MALLORY:  -- day.
     
16)	Update from public works director and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item 16.  Update from public works director and all other matters properly related thereto.
     BERT RAMOS:  All righty.  I got a lot of stuff to update on.
     So I'll start with -- I don't know if we can do anything or if you guys can do anything.  But I would like to make mention of it.  But we're having a real problem in our office with -- with getting the bills from the Treasurer's Office to our office and getting them posted.
     And so we're -- we're tagging people's accounts.  And if people want to sell their property or then we're sending out late notices to -- to all these people that have paid their bill.
     And this is going back as far as five and six months at this point.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  You're talking about water bills.
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Okay.
     BERT RAMOS:  So I'm not sure how we can address this.  But it's -- I mean, if we've got to put somebody else on staff to help with this problem -- 
     It's -- it's becoming a -- a serious issue with -- you know, I mean.  It just kills a ton of time with people calling and we're checking their bill.  And they proved that they've paid it back for the last five months.  And it's never been communicated. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  So who's behind?  The Treasurer's Office that's sending out -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  Yes. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- the bill?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Treasurer's Office is supposed to send it over to us to let us know that it has been paid.  
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And you've talked to them?  And you've tried -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  We've -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- to resolve? 
     BERT RAMOS:  Multiple times.
     So --
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  So where do you need another person?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Customer service.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  I don't -- I -- I don't know if they need to be in the Treasurer's Office or -- or just running back and forth between the two offices checking who's paid their bill.  
     But it's just something that needs to be addressed.  I don't know how to address this.  We've went over to the Treasurer's Office and tried to get this addressed because the -- the -- trying to do the correlation and getting everything back to square is -- is a lot of work on the secretaries.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, we could put it on the agenda to have them come before us.  But since we aren't meeting for a while, I think that's a little bit long.  So could we just ask the executive director to please take it up with our elected official and that office and see if we can have a special box they could just put them in and somebody else pick them up and Tammy come over and pick them up once a day or something?  
     BERT RAMOS:  But we've just got to get them posted.  If that means we go over there and pick stuff up.  But if it's not in the -- in the run, then when they post it on the computer it -- they just post what's they've been given.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No, this is -- not only is it county business, but -- but this is customer service for our county.  And this is really poor.  So it -- it cannot be tolerated.  We need to do it.  And so, hopefully, by you handling it, even though it's not your position, that will take care of it.  And then if you'll let us know at the next meeting -- actually, I don't want to wait till the next meeting.  You and Keith talk and see if this is coming out.  If it's not, I want it agendized for the next meeting and we'll have everybody in our office.  Okay?
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  And I think --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I agree.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah.  Good enough.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  -- to add to that, maybe Keith is -- is a discussion with -- with the treasurer possibly and the public works secretary to -- to have them talk with you to see what is going to work best to help her job and to get this done.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  We need to expedite it.  And we don't need another person, I don't think --
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  No, it's just -- you know -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  No, just these -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  -- this is.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- that's the problem.
     BERT RAMOS:  We've been doing bills for -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  It's never been -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  -- how many years now? 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Yeah.  It's never been a problem before.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No.
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Yeah.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  So some i- -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Okay. 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Some idea of a -- a future update on -- if it gets resolved, if you could let us know what the problem was --
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Okay.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- so that we're aware of --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Not just -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- what -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- that it -- 
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  -- what the short -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- went away but what caused it?
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Gee.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  That would be nice.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you, Bert.
     BERT RAMOS:  Uh-huh.  
     Okay.  Now, Kylie, myself, and Anna, we met with the CMAR for the Indian casino.  And it looks like they're going to be moving forward.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Oh, cool.
     BERT RAMOS:  So they -- they really want to put, you know, a water main in.  They're going to -- they're going to be getting the BLM portion of the ground over there is what it looks like, between the school and the casino there.  And then I believe you -- maybe some of that other ground that's over there is -- is privately owned.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     BERT RAMOS:  So that -- 
     You know, I -- I'm going to have to ask for your guys' permission to start negotiations with them on -- on maybe some cost sharing on that water line and -- and then bring it back to you, obviously, for approval.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I think that's well within your realm of -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  Just to -- just to kind of keep the ball rolling for them and -- and keep everything going.  
     And then AM -- AM Engineering and myself met with the Nevada Lands.  And -- and this is also -- they also would like water to run from kind of back here behind the courthouse all the way back over to the airport.  And they own almost all that land that's there.  And they're willing to give us the easement, do some cost sharing on the water main as well.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  What are -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  I know -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- they building?
     BERT RAMOS:  -- that we did have some -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  So the water line would go all the way to airport?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  We did -- we did have a budget for -- for that.  This could just save the county a pile of money.  And, you know, and it could be good for them, a win on both sides.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  And then -- 
     BERT RAMOS:  So I'll --
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- a cost share?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Yeah.  So I'll be back.  You know, like I say, we'll negotiate with that.  And then we'll be back in front of you guys with -- with some -- with some solid numbers on -- on where that stands.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Good deal. 
     BERT RAMOS:  We had a rodeo this last weekend.  It was the high school rodeo here.
     Turned out absolutely outstanding.  There was a ton of people there.  Had a ton of compliments on the rodeo grounds.
     You know, I'd like to thank, like, all the Road and Bridge guys there.  There was Don Prince, Jerry Russell, and Jim Lucas.  Jack Durham, Mark Hammond and Carrie Baum, along with Brad Olson and John Mauldin.  They made it happen.  There wouldn't have been a rodeo had them guys all not jumped in down there, because the wasps were so far out of hand that I've never -- you couldn't have kept stock in -- in any of the pens.  So it -- but it turned out good.  So that was a good thing to see for the community.  
     And then real quick on the Bonus, Echo Bay, and Silver State and truck -- the truck fill projects over here.  We're about to wrap them up.  We're about a month away.  And we have not had any water infiltration over here on Silver State.  So that is -- that's really good.
     We're currently -- we have one change order.  And it's a credit to the county for $8,068.  And we still have our $75,000 force account along -- along with our dewatering.  So that job's coming out really well.  
     And then on our purple pipe projects, these aren't solid -- solid numbers.  But we have about two weeks.  We're actually dropping the part we were waiting for for Well 3 to go into service.  And that's happening today.  Should have been happening about an hour ago.  And approximately -- we have a change order there as well for 20,000.
     And with our force account, we still have $50,000 in there as well that hasn't been touched.  So we're -- we're doing really good there on both them jobs.  
     And then -- let me see.  Is there anyone on the commission that feels I'm insufficient anywhere in my job or anything that I'm doing here?  Or would like to point.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I think you're doing a good job, Bert.  I've told you that a number of times.  
     BERT RAMOS:  Okay.  Now the -- now the reason I'm going to ask this -- and this is getting really old.  And I'm -- I'm just going to defer and I'm going to get to it here.  
     But -- so at the last commission meeting, I pointed out an issue that Ms. Allan had with some signage on -- on vehicles and the county pickups.  And -- and in doing so, I followed the proper procedure, the procedure that I'm told to follow to get this done.
     So me and Keith, I've -- I've been with the county for coming on eight years now.  I've never been verbally reprimanded.  I've never been written up.  I've never had one issue with this county at all.  I've tried to do a good job.  
     Keith came to me.  And Ms. Allan went to him and wanted me reprimanded for insubordination for the way that I had composed myself at this last meeting.  
     And so after getting my verbal, I -- you know, Keith's following his proper procedures, what he's got to -- what he's got to do as far as the disciplinary action.  You start with your verbal.  You go to your written.  And he was directed to do so by, you know, one of his bosses, which is Ms. Allan.  
     And so at this time, I'm going tell the commission that -- and the DA's Office and Keith as well that this has went far enough.  And the games have to stop.  This can't be tolerated anymore.  And this commission, Ted and Keith, you guys, are the only ones that can do anything about it within this county to keep it in-house.  And I don't want this thing to go out of house.  But if -- if that's where it has to go, then that's what has to be.  But it has to end because I have a lot better things to do with my time and the taxpayers' money than -- than that.
     So that's all I have to say about it.  But it -- it's time that it all come to a sliding stop.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Bert, I think that your efforts have been trying to portray transparency with everything that you're doing.  I mean, you brought things back to us that you really didn't need to.  But there was a little bit of change in the plan.  And you brought it back to us so that we could approve the change.  And it was within budget; am I right?  
     BERT RAMOS:  Correct.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Right.  I -- I've got -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Bert, I think -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- no -- 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- you're doing a good -- 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  -- complaints. 
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  -- job.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I agree.
     And if there is something to be done, I guess, Doug and Sean and Keith need to get together and see what they can do.
     BERT RAMOS:  Okay.  So I just wanted to -- I just wanted to state that so it was on the record.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Thank you.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Thank you, Bert.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Thank you, Bert.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Thank you, Bert. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I think you're doing a good job, Bert.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Are you going to visit the sinkhole today?
     BERT RAMOS:  Oh, yes.  We are.
     There is a good sinkhole in Austin as well that just showed up out of the blue.  So I'm going to go visit that.  
     And the cemetery fence in Austin got tore down over the wine walk.  And it's getting repaired too.  
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Wasn't me.  I was at the wine walk, but it wasn't me.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  It's got to be story --
     BERT RAMOS:  (Indiscernible) if you're walking.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  There's a story behind that one.  
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  I think I saw your initials up there on -- on the -- up there at the castle, Bert.  
     I know I found Artie's and Branson's.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Do we have any public comment on that agenda item?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Seventeen?
     
     
FINANCE
     
17)	Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove a change in the purchase order amount from $500 to an amount not to exceed $1500 for all department purchasing, and all other matters properly related thereto.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Moving on to 17.  Discussion for possible action to approve/disapprove a change in the purchase order amount from $500 to an amount not to exceed $1500 for all department purchasing, and all other matters properly related thereto.  
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Currently, we have our -- excuse me -- we have our purchase order limit set at $500.  The Finance Department has a -- a $500 purchase nowadays is really nothing.  It overwhelms them with purchase orders and paperwork and so forth.
     Last year, I talked to the auditors about this and again -- and again this year.
     Their recommendation was to move -- to bump it up to $1500 before anybody would have to go get a purchase order.
     It's going to save some paperwork and time, quite a bit of paperwork and time within the -- the Finance Department.
     So that's my request, that we bump it up to $1500.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  You're right.  $1500 isn't very much money anymore.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Right.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  I'll make a motion to approve the change in the purchase order amount from 500 to an amount not to exceed $1,500 for all department purchasing.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Second.  
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Sean made a motion.  Art seconded.  
     Do we have any public comment?
     (No comment.)
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  All in favor?
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Aye.
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Aye.
     COMMISSIONER BAKKER:  Opposed?

CORRESPONDENCE 
     
18)	Correspondence, reports, potential upcoming agenda items.
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Item 18.  Correspondence, reports, potential upcoming agenda items.
     
     (The following correspondence was received:
     1.	Monthly reports to Lander county Commissioners.  July 2017.
     2.	United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Mount Lewis Field Office, letter dated September 1, 2017, regarding publishing in the Federal Register the Notice of Availability for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Newmont USA Limited's Greater Phoenix Project, proposed expansion.
     3.	United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Tonopah Field Office, regarding preparation of Environmental Assessment of impacts of Round Mountain Phase W Expansion Project.
     4.	Town of Kingston, Kingston Town Water Utility, letter to Lander County Commissioners expressing gratitude for the Lander County Road and Bridge South's response to flash flooding.
     5.	State of Nevada, Department of Conservation & Natural Resources, Second Quarter 2017 Monitoring Report of groundwater monitoring of site formerly called Ted's Chevron.
     6.	United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Mount Lewis Field Office, Final Decision for Argenta Round III Grazing Exclosures within the Argenta Allotment.)
     
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  One of the first things that I -- I would like on the record with our correspondence is the lovely complimentary letter that Kingston wrote to our Road and Bridge.  Did you get a copy of that, Bert?
     BERT RAMOS:  I did not.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  No?
     Okay.  You need to because it was from the town board, thanking Road and Bridge through the flood and -- and what they had done.  
     And so I wanted that to be on the record.  
     I'm glad they took the time to do it.  And I'm glad they're so appreciative.  And I'm glad we were right there for them.  So that's a plus.
     The other thing I wanted to comment on is there's quite a few things in here.  One of them was from the Nevada Division of Environ- -- Environmental Protection.
     And if you take a look at that, it isn't just our address that's wrong.  I think they have our chairman as Chuck Chapin.  And I'm going, I think we're really outdated.  And I would appreciate our executive director authorizing somebody to notify them.  Oh, Nilla has some information.  
     DEONILLA FULLER:  I do.  I have contacted NDEP -- 
     COMMISSIONER ALLAN:  Excuse me.
     DEONILLA FULLER:  Nilla Fuller, for the record.  I have contacted numerous departments.  And every time I call, they send me to somebody else.  I have tried to correct it.  I don't know who else to call.  Every time I call the number on there, they're like, oh, you have to contact this office.  They transfer me.  We'll take care of it.  The next month, it's wrong again.  So I will continue to try.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I would -- I'll -- I'll turn that to your supervisor and have him personally call somebody.  
     DEONILLA FULLER:  So I have been -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  How's that?  
     DEONILLA FULLER:  -- working on it a little bit --
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.  
     DEONILLA FULLER:  -- at a time. 
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Did you actually talk to a human being?
     DEONILLA FULLER:  Yes.  Several of them.  I call every -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Thank you.  
     DEONILLA FULLER:  -- month.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  That's great.
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  I'm glad you saw it.  It really was old.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Well, I think we need to have an agenda item to address Bert's concern, however it needs to be done.
     I don't know exactly all the details.  But Bert asked for some kind of attention brought.  Is the agenda the proper place to do this?
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  No.  Well, yes.  
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Well, I thought -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It is the proper -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Excuse me.  
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  -- place because no one commissioner can -- can get into day-to-day operations with Bert.  They can't do it.  General.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.  So -- 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  Excuse me, but I -- I -- 
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  That simple. 
     COMMISSIONER WAITS:  -- I thought what Bert wanted was for just to be handled in-house and not -- to -- to be a public item.
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  Well, it won't be a public item if -- if one commissioner starts interfering in the day-to-day operations.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Did you want it on the agenda, Bert?
     BERT RAMOS:  (Indiscernible, too far from the microphones.)
     DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERRERA:  It will go outside the county if that continues.  
     BERT RAMOS:  It'd probably be a closed session if it's a personnel.
     KEITH WESTENGARD:  Yes.
     COMMISSIONER CLARK:  Okay.  If it's not settled?  Okay.   
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Any other items?
     
     
PUBLIC COMMENT 
     
     CHAIRMAN MILLS:  Okay.  We'll go into public comment for nonagendized items only.

All public comment may be limited to three minutes per person, again at the discretion of the board.
